Fortunately, most anarchists in the US avoid any ideological orthodoxy and
shun sectarian divides. Unfortunately, most of us also seem to avoid serious
strategizing. Those who do take this on tend more towards one or another
orthodoxy, and reading the pages of the country’s anarchist journals an
outsider would get the impression that the movement here is indeed sectarian.
In fact there are many controversies, and no clear tectonic splits, but one
divide that is growing more sharp is the same one that runs through much of
Europe, the debate between insurrection and organization. The former overlap
with post-Leftist anarchists, the latter are often anarchist-communists. Here
in Greece, where I’ve spent the past couple weeks, the divide is very strong
between insurrectionary anarchists associated with the Black Bloc, and the
heavily organized Antiauthoritarian Movement (AK, in Greek).

In this and most other controversies I see anarchists becoming embroiled in,
there seems to be a lingering affinity for certain Western values that are at
the heart of the state and capitalism: a worldview based on dichotomies, and a
logical structure that is startlingly monotheistic. For example, when there
are two different strategies for revolution, many of us do not see this as two
paths for different groups of people to walk, taking their own while also
trying to understand the path of the Other, but as evidence that somebody must
be Wrong (and it is almost certainly the Other).

Those of us who were raised with white privilege were trained to be very bad
listeners, and it’s a damn shame that we still haven’t absorbed the emphasis
on pluralism taught by the Magonistas and indigenous anarchists. I would love
to blame our current disputes on the internet, because clearly it’s so easy to
be an asshole to somebody and sabotage any healthy, two-way conversation of
differences if you’ve already abstracted them to words on a glowing screen,
but schisms are much older than telecommunications (though no doubt our heavy
reliance on the internet makes it more likely that disagreements will turn
into counterproductive squabbles).

Call me naive but I think that a large part of the infighting can be chalked
up to bad communication and a fundamentally monotheistic worldview more than
to the actual substance of the differing strategies. No doubt, the substance
is important. There are for example some necessary critiques of how the Left
manages rebellion that have been circulated by (I hesitate to use easy labels
but for convenience sake I’ll call them:) insurrectionary anarchists, but even
if certain people have figured out all the right answers nothing will stop
them from going the way of the first anarchist movement if we don’t all learn
better ways of communicating, and understanding, our differences.

In Greece, the schism between insurrectionists and the Antiauthoritarian
Movement has even led to physical fighting. There are people on both sides who
have done fucked up things. The Black Bloc threw some molotovs at police in
the middle of a melee, burning some of the protestors. People with AK bullied
and beat up anarchists whom they suspected of stealing some computers from the
university during an event AK organized, getting them in trouble. In response,
some insurrectionists burned down the Antiauthoritarian Movement’s offices in
Thessaloniki. If we generalize, the stereotypes quickly step in to assure us
that the other side is the enemy: “those disorganized insurrectionists are
even throwing molotovs at other protestors!” or “those organizationalists are
acting like the police of the movement.” In each case, we can quickly see a
preconstructed image of the lazy, chaotic insurrectionist, or the practically
Marxist authoritarian so-called anarchist, and what we’re doing is abstracting
the actual people involved.

I don’t want to suggest that certain or all of these groups don’t have serious
flaws they need to work on. I don’t even believe both sides are equally to
blame. In fact I tend to get into pretty nasty throw-downs myself with people
who prefer some bullshit, hippy “I’m okay, you’re okay, everyone’s okay” form
of conflict resolution that avoids criticism in favour of an appearance of
peace. But in Thessaloniki and Athena I met people from both sides, and most
of them were very nice, people whom I would love to have as neighbors after we
smashed the state together. Some of them badmouthed the other group, some of
them were really trying to make peace, also talking critically to members of
their own group who had wronged someone from the other side. On the whole,
though, they are a minority, and the divide grows. Posters for a presentation
I was giving in Athena got ripped down because the social center hosting me
was associated with AK (though the people actually organizing the event and
putting me up were not members, and tried to stay in the middle). The squat I
stayed at in Thessaloniki was occupied by people aligned with the
insurrectionists, and several of them told me not to mix with the AK people in
Athena.

I might classify those problems as peculiar to Greece if I had not seen
similar divides in Germany and Bulgaria, heard invective from the same kind of
infighting in France spill over into the Montreal Anarchist Bookfair, and read
plenty of these arguments in the anarchist press of the UK and US. Since the
US is where I’m from and where I’ll return, I will focus on the schism as it
appears there. Because most US anarchists seem to focus on their day to day
activities, I think many have not taken sides in this schism, are not even
aware of it. So to a certain extent it exists as a theoretical disagreement,
without yet the improbable weight of strident personalities thrown into the
fray (well, some people from Anarchy magazine or NEFAC might say otherwise),
fixing intransigent frontlines by virtue of the fact that an ideology
personified is all the more stubborn. So we have a greater opportunity, for
now, to deal with the problem theoretically.

As a sort of appendix, I’ve included critiques of four essays from the two
sides of the debate, but first I will generalize what I see as the strengths
and weaknesses of each. Insurrectionists make a number of vital contributions,
perhaps the most important being that the time is now, that the distinction
between building alternatives and attacking capitalism is a false one. The
critique of leftist bureaucracy as a recuperating force, the state within the
movement that constantly brings rebellion back into the fold and preserves
capitalism, is also right-on, though often the word “organization” is used
instead of bureaucracy, which can confuse things because to many people even
an affinity group is also a type of organization. Or it can lead to a certain
fundamentalism, as some people do intend to excommunicate all formal
organizations, even if they are understood by the participants as a temporary
tool and not a “one big union.”

The insurrectionists also nurture a number of weaknesses. Their frequent
criticisms of “activism” tend to be superficial and vague, reflecting more an
inability to come to terms with their personal failures (or observed failures)
in other modes of action, than any improved theoretical understanding,
practically guaranteeing that the faults they encountered in activism will be
replicated or simply inverted in whatever they end up doing as
insurrectionists. (This point will be developed more in the appendix). There
is also a certain lack of clarity in insurrectionist suggestions for action.
Insurrectionists tend to do a good job in making a point of learning from
people who are not anarchists, drawing on recent struggles in Mexico,
Argentina, Algeria, and so on. However this also allows them to blur the
difference between what is insurrectionary and what is insurrectionist. Much
as most of them forswear ideology, by mining historical examples of
insurrection to extract and distill a common theory and prescription for
action, they earn that “ist” and distinguish what is insurrectionary from what
is insurrectionist. They have perceptively grasped that what is
insurrectionary in a social struggle is often the most effective, most honest,
and most anarchist element of the struggle; but by seeing through an
insurrectionist lens they discount or ignore all the other elements of the
struggle to which the insurrectionary is tied, even, in many cases, on which
it is based. In this instance the “ist” carries with it that monotheistic
insistence that any elements reducible to another “ism” must be incorrect. So
we are told to open our eyes when the people in Oaxaca burn buses and defend
autonomous spaces, but close our eyes when the strikes carried out by the
teachers’ union give birth in large part to the insurrection, when the rebels
choose to organize themselves formally or above ground for a certain purpose.

Insurrectionists call for action inside or outside social movements, which I
agree with. People should fight for themselves, for their own reasons and own
lives, even if they have to fight alone. This is, after all, how many social
movements exist at the beginning, before they are recognized as social
movements. To contradict a criticism I have seen from some more
organizationally minded anarchists, it is not at all vanguardist to take
action first or even attempt to escalate actions, because fighting for your
own reasons or attempting to inspire other people to action by example is
quite the opposite of vanguardism. In fact a common sign of a vanguardist is
one who objects to other people running ahead of the flock (and consequently
ahead of the flock’s vanguard). However this insurrectionist stance is
sometimes accompanied by a disparaging view of social movements, as though any
movement is inherently authoritarian, inherently bureaucratic, inherently
recuperative (in Green Anarchy I even read one fairly silly call for
“momentum” instead of movements, though if the author of this piece was doing
anything besides redefining “movement” as “the bad sort of movement” and
defining everything else as “momentum” it wasn’t very clear, because of that
preference for words instead of meanings fashionable among many
[anti]political writers). But we should not underestimate the importance of
social movements. I recently had the opportunity to spend five months among
anarchists in the former Soviet bloc, primarily in Ukraine, Romania, and
Bulgaria. Unanimously, the anarchists I met told me that the socialist
dictatorships had destroyed and subsequently prevented any social movements,
and left a legacy of people who hate and distrust the government (many of them
are also dissatisfied with capitalism) but who also have no tradition or
inclination to trust and participate in social movements, or even cooperate
with their neighbors. The anarchist situation there is far bleaker than it is
in the US: the anarchists are alone, isolated, without any clear starting
point for action, much less insurrection. One Romanian anarchist said
organizing in his home country was like going to a foreign country where you
don’t speak the language and trying to build anarchy. (In Poland and Czech
[Republic], the anarchist movement is much stronger, and these are also the
countries that developed dissident social movements in the ‘80s. Incidentally
the dictatorship in Romania was toppled not by a movement but by an
insurrection that was largely stage-managed — these too can be recuperated).
In light of this, it seems a glaring absence that insurrectionists tend to
avoid actions or analysis focused on building up social movement (if by
movement we only mean a large informal network or population, that may include
formal organizations, and that constitutes itself as a social force in
response to perceived problems, initially acting outside the scope of
previously routinized and institutionalized forms of social activity).

Insurrectionist suggestions for action tend to revolve around creating
autonomous spaces that support us, allow us to practice communal, anarchist
living now, and serve as a base for waging war against the state. This is as
good as any other singular anarchist strategy, in fact it’s a good deal better
than a few, but also like the other strategies in circulation it has already
been defeated by the state. Insurrectionists in the US don’t even need to use
that typical American excuse of amnesia; in this case, isolationism is to
blame. The largely anarchist squatters’ movement that thrived across Western
Europe in the ‘70s and ‘80s (and shadows of which still survive), including
the German Autonomen, already attempted — in a very serious way — the same
strategy that US insurrectionists are now circulating without any differences
serious enough to be considered a revision or lesson from past failures. And
they are likely, if they ever get a half of the momentum the Europeans had,
which under present circumstances is improbable, to end up exactly the same
way: an isolated, drug-addicted wasteland of ghettoized subculture frozen in a
self-parodying gesture of defiance (yes, this is a pessimistic view, and one
that discounts the several wonderful squats and social centers that are still
hanging on, but I think insurrectionists would agree there’s no point in
looking for the bright side of a movement that has come to accommodate
capitalism). It goes something like this: the state and the culture industry
isolate them (operating almost like Daoist martial artists, pushing them in
the direction they’re already going, only harder than they intended), by many
accounts flood in addictive drugs, which come to fill a new need as the stress
mounts from the prolonged state of siege brought about by frequent attacks
from police; not everyone can live under those conditions, especially older
folks and those with children [who] drop out or turn to more escapist, less
combative forms. The militants stay within their circle of barricades for so
long that in-crowd aesthetics and mentalities entrench, they are, after all,
at war with the rest of the world by now. Eventually the rebels lose any real
connections with the outside world, and any possibility to spread the
struggle. Thus weakened and lacking external solidarity, half the squats are
evicted, one by one, and the others become exhausted and give up the fight.

Because of their proximity to that history, a particular group of French
anarchists could not just ignore the weaknesses of the strategy. This group,
the authors of Appel (Call), the most intelligent and insightful
insurrectionist (if I can give it a label it has not claimed for itself) tract
I have come across, hit the nail on the head when, advancing a more developed
and lively form of this strategy, they pointed out that the squatters’
movement died because it stopped strategizing (and thus stopped growing and
changing, stagnated). However, more than one nail is needed to hold the
strategy together. Stagnation was the likely outcome of the squatters’
movement due to its very structure, and the consequent structure of state
repression. The falling off of strategizing was a probable result of the
strategy itself.

And what about the organizationalists? First I should note that this is a
rather amorphous group, and few people actually identify themselves as
organizationalists. A good part of them are the old or classical anarchists —
anarchist-communists whose strategy rests in part on creating a strong
federation of anarchists, or syndicalists building anarchist labor unions, or
otherwise working in the labor movement. Some in this camp are social
anarchists who prefer an involvement in mainstream society to waging anything
that resembles war (class or insurrectionary). More than a few are anarchist
activists working above ground with some organization around a particular
issue, perhaps without a clear long-term strategy, who have been swept in with
the others by insurrectionist criticisms. I will focus on the classical
anarchists, because they have more clearly articulated strategies (this is not
at all to criticize the others, after all no strategy can be better than a
simplistic, dogmatic one). Hopefully the criticisms I make there will be
informative for all anarchists who consider the use of formal organizations.

On the one hand, the emphasis of these anarchists on building social movements
and being accessible to outsiders is well placed. Clearly a major problem of
US anarchists is isolation, and organizing in above-ground groups around
problems that are apparent to broader populations can help overcome this
isolation. It is extremely helpful when there are types of anarchist action
people can get involved in that are relatively easy, that don’t require a
plunge straight from mainstream life into uncompromising war against the
system (to go off on a tangent, insurrectionists often praise the
replicability of certain actions, but I wonder how many started off as
activism-oriented anarchists and how many were insurrectionists from the
beginning. In other words, how replicable is insurrectionist anarchism for
most people?)

The communication and coordination that, say, a federation can provide can be
helpful in certain instances. In Europe many of the prisoner support
organizations that anarchists of all kinds rely on are organized as
federations. Organizations can also build and escalate the struggle. For
example, the actions of an anarchist labor union can make anarchism accessible
to more people, by providing an immediately apprehendable way to get involved,
a forum for spreading ideas, and a demonstration of the sincerity and
practicality of anarchists winning improvements in the short-term. I would
also wager that people who have gotten some practice in a union, and learned
first-hand about strikes for example, are more likely to launch a wildcat
strike than people who have never been part of a union.

An approach that relies heavily on formal organizations also has a number of
weaknesses. Since these weaknesses have appeared and reappeared in no
uncertain terms for over a century, it’s a damn shame to have to repeat them,
but unfortunately there seems to be the need. Democratic organizations with
any form of representation can quickly become bureaucratic and authoritarian.
Direct democratic organizations still run the risk of being dominated by
political animals (as Bob Black pointed out in more detail in Anarchy After
Leftism). And there is something problematic in the first instance [when] a
society separates the economic from the political and creates a limited space
for decision-making wherein decisions have more authority than those decisions
and communications enacted elsewhere in social life. Organizations should be
temporary, tied to the need they were formed to address, and they should be
overlapping and pluralistic. Otherwise, they develop interests of their own
survival and growth that can easily conflict with the needs of people. This
organizational self-interest has been used time and time again to control and
recuperate radical social movements. It should long ago have become obvious
that using formal organizations is risky, something best done with caution.
Yet some organizational anarchists even persist in believing that all
anarchists should join a single organization. I have never seen an argument
for how this could possibly be effective, and the question is irrelevant since
it is neither possible nor would it be liberating. Voluntary association is a
meaningless principle if you expect everyone to join a particular
organization, even if it is perfect. But I’ve still heard a number of
anarchist-communists use that obnoxious line, “they’re not real anarchists,”
on the basis that these not-anarchists did not want to work with them. The
interest of working together in an effective organization, especially if it is
singular (as in, The Only Anarchist Group You’ll Ever Need to Join!),
encourages conformity of ideas among members, which can cause them to waste a
great deal of time coming up with the Correct Line and can make them a pain in
the ass for other folks to work with. (The 1995 pamphlet “The Role of the
Revolutionary Organization” by the Anarchist Communist Federation is very
clear that they see theirs as only a single one of many organizations working
in the movement, and they renounce the aim of any kind of organizational
hegemony; perhaps the problem is the lack of a deep recognition that these
many organizations may approach, relate to, or conceive of the movement in
entirely different ways).

Hopefully by now it is clear how these two tendencies can cooperate for
greater effect. First of all, by abandoning that horrible pretension that just
because the Other disagrees with our point of view, they have nothing valid to
offer. It follows from this that we recognize different people will prefer to
be active in different ways, and in fact different temperaments draw people
towards different anarchist tendencies before theory ever comes into it. Some
people will never want to go to your boring meetings or organize in their
workplace (they won’t even want to have a workplace). Some people will never
want to set foot in your nasty-assed squat or live in fear that the state will
take away their kids because of the lifestyle of the parents (or they won’t
even want to subject their kids to the stress of a life of constant warfare).
And guess what? That’s fine and natural. If. If we can cover each other’s
backs. Above ground organizers who build support for the insurrectionists, who
stand by those masked terrorists instead of denouncing them, will create a
stronger movement. Insurrectionists who carry out the waves of sabotage the
organizers are too exposed to call for, who keep in touch with the outside
world and also keep the organizers honest and aware of the broader picture,
the horizon of possibility, will create a stronger movement.
Organizationalists who exclude the insurrectionists help them isolate
themselves. Insurrectionists who see the organizers as the enemy help them
recuperate the struggle. These are self-fulfilling prophecies.
Insurrectionists can be helped by the movement-building and social resources
of the organizationalists, who in turn can be helped by the more radical
perspective and sometimes stronger tactics, the dreams put into practice, of
the insurrectionists.

Because the US anarchist movement often looks to Greece for inspiration,
especially the insurrectionists, I find it interesting that the Greek
experience seems to show the two approaches to be complementary, even if the
organizations involved are bitter enemies. In the [U.S.] we usually hear about
the Greeks when they attack a police station or burn surveillance cameras;
basically every week. But we do not hear about the foundation that makes this
possible. For starters Greece enjoys a more anarchic culture. Family ties are
stronger than state loyalties (Greek anarchists were shocked to learn that a
number of prisoners in the US were turned in by relatives), there is
widespread distrust of authority, and many people still remember the military
dictatorship and understand the potential necessity of fighting with cops. US
culture is not nearly so supportive of our efforts, so we need to figure out
how to influence the broader culture so it will be more fertile for anarchy.

The state has been doing the opposite for centuries. I couldn’t tell how much
the anarchists in Greece influenced the surrounding culture and how much they
just took advantage of it, but there were many clearly conscious attempts to
influence the social situation. A great deal of activism goes into opposing
the European Union immigration regime, working with and supporting immigrants,
and the squatted social centers play a role in this. Such work also helps make
the anarchist movement more diverse. Labor organizing plays a role in Greece,
though I learned much less about this while I was there. In Athena the
foundation that keeps much of the local anarchist movement alive and kicking
is a neighbourhood — Exarchia. This entire quarter, located in the center of
the capital, has the feel of a semi-autonomous zone. You can spraypaint on the
walls in broad daylight with little risk (wheatpasting is even safer), you see
more anarchist propaganda than commercial advertising, and you rarely
encounter cops. In fact you’re likely to find nervous squads of riot police
standing guard along the neighbourhood’s borders (nervous because it’s not
uncommon for them to be attacked). The autonomous spaces, the destruction of
surveillance cameras, the Molotov attacks on cops are all characteristic of
the insurrectionary approach. But also important to the rebellious makeup of
Exarchia are the language classes for immigrants organized by social centers,
the friendly relationships with neighbors (something the Black Bloc types
don’t always excel at cultivating) and even, curiously, some anarchist-owned
businesses. In the US, the phrase “anarchist business” would be scoffed at
contemptuously, though one would also avoid applying it to anarchist
bookstores, which are recognized as legitimate. But in Exarchia (and this was
also the case in Berlin and Hamburg) the anarchist movement was bolstered by a
number of anarchist-owned establishments, particularly bars. I think the
rationale is fairly solid. If some anarchists need to get jobs in the
meantime, and this is certainly more the case in the US than in most of
Europe, it can be better to own your own bar that you open as a resource to
the movement than to work at a Starbucks. Likewise, if anarchists are going to
gather at a bar every Friday night (and this could also apply to movie
theaters and a number of other things), why not go to one that supports a
friend, and supports the movement (as an event space and even a source of
donations)? It can also provide experience building collectives, and edge out
the local bourgeoisie who would otherwise be a reactionary force in a
semi-autonomous neighbourhood. I sure as hell ain’t advocating “buying out the
capitalists” as a revolutionary strategy, but in Exarchia and elsewhere
anarchist businesses, in this strictly limited sense, have played a role in
creating a stronger movement.

Most important, if we want to consider the strength of Greek anarchists, has
been the student movement. For a year, university students (along with
professors and even many high school students) have been on strike, protesting
a neoliberal education reform that would corporatize universities, privatize
some of them, and end the official tradition of asylum that forbids police to
set foot on Greek campuses. At the most superficial level, this student
movement has allowed the anarchists many more opportunities to fight with the
police. Getting a little deeper, it is perhaps the social conflict in Greece
with the most potential to lead to an insurrectionary situation, similar in
some regards to Paris in 1968. A strictly organizational strategy, whether of
the typical syndicalist or anarchist-communist varieties, will be too weak,
and too tame. Another organization will just be a competitor with the
communist parties, and will have a conservative effect on the passions of the
students, who show the tendency to blow up and act out quite ahead of the
plans and predictions of the organizations, which are the ones getting the
heat from the authorities. A strictly insurrectionary approach will isolate
the anarchists from the student movement, who will increasingly view them as
parasites who only come to fight with the cops. Without the involvement of an
anarchist perspective, nothing will stop the political parties from
controlling the movement. And anarchists are unlikely to gain much respect in
the student movement if they disdain working for the short-term goal of
defeating this education law. Putting aside the dogma about reformism,
everyone should be able to see the tragic tactical loss anarchists would
suffer if the universities had their asylum privilege revoked (right now,
people can attack a group of cops and then run back into the university and be
safe), and of course a fierce movement using direct action is much more likely
to dissuade the government from putting this education reform into effect than
a passive movement dominated by party politics.

By fighting the police, taking over the streets, and squatting the
universities, anarchists can inspire people, ignite passions, capture the
national attention and raise the fear, which everyone immediately smells and
is intoxicated by, that things can change. By spreading anarchist ideas,
turning the universities into free schools, setting up occupation committees,
organizing strikes, and preventing the domination of the student assemblies by
the political parties, other anarchists can provide a bridge for more people
to be involved, make overtures for solidarity to other sectors of society, and
strengthen the movement that has provided a basis for the possibility of
change. If these two types of anarchists work together, the insurrectionary
ones are less likely to be disowned as outsiders and isolated, thrown to the
police, because they have allies in the very middle of the movement. And when
the state approaches the organized anarchists in the movement in an attempt to
negotiate, they are less likely to give in because they have friends outside
the organization holding them accountable and reminding them that power is in
the streets.

Similar lessons on the potential compatibility of these two approaches can be
drawn from anarchist history in Spain of ’36 or France of ’68. Both of these
episodes ultimately showed that insurrection is a higher form of struggle,
that waiting for the right moment is reactionary, that bureaucratic
organizations such as the CNT or the French students’ union end up
collaborating with power and recuperating the movement. But what is easier to
miss is that insurrectionary tactics were not the major force in creating the
necessary foundation. The CNT and the French students’ union were both
instrumental in building the revolution (the former by spreading anarchist
ideas, launching strikes and insurrections, building connections of
solidarity, preparing workers to take over the economy, and defeating the
fascist coup in much of Spain; the latter by disseminating radical critiques
[at least by certain branches], organizing the student strike and occupation,
and organizing assemblies for collective decision making). The failing was
when they did not recognize that their usefulness had passed, that as vital as
they were those organizations were not the revolution. (This is not at all to
say there should be a preparatory period, during which insurrectionary tactics
are premature. Clandestine attacks at any stage can help build a fierce
movement. Waiting to attack until the movement is large leaves you with a
large, weak movement, with no experience in the tactics that will be necessary
to grow or even survive the mounting repression. It might even leave you with
a large, pacifist movement, which would just be awful.)

Between living in a squat or living in an apartment and organizing a tenants’
association, there are inevitably going to be people who strongly prefer one
or the other, whether or not we bring theory into the picture. This should be
a good thing, because both of these actions can help bring about an anarchist
world. When anarchists give up our narrow dogmatism and embrace the complexity
that exists in any revolutionary process, we will [be] closer.

Because I guess I’m not really happy with a happy ending, I’ll conclude by
pointing out some problems that I think are common to both tendencies. I’ve
already mentioned the monotheistic mentality that leads to schisms within the
movement, but especially in the US this exists on a larger scale as an
inability of most anarchists to work in a healthy way with those outside the
movement. This has been a failure to figure out what makes other Americans
tick, what they are passionate about, what sphere of their lives is illegal,
under what circumstances they will rebel, and how to engage them on this.
There is no simple answer, and the complex answers will differ between
regions, communities, and individuals, but I think most anarchists of all
stripes have stuck to self-referential and repetitive actions rather than
plunging into this tedious work. Granted, people in the US aren’t the easiest
population for anarchists to engage; our culture encourages conformity,
isolation, and the Protestant work ethic more strongly than most others. But
we should take this as a challenge and get on with it.

The inability to work well with others is also the manifestation of another
Western value that contradicts anarchism more blatantly than monotheism, and
it is the Risk board mentality, that ingrained view of the world from above,
with ourselves positioned as the architect or general. It is the understanding
that you change society by forcing people to organize themselves in a certain
way. The more classical anarchists put themselves at one extreme, thus
occasioning many of the criticisms that they are authoritarian or Marxist, by
pushing a program or insisting that revolution only occurs when people see the
world through the narrow lens of class consciousness. The insurrectionists
have caught a whiff of this and they go to the other extreme by forswearing
activism and to a large extent avoiding contact with people who are much
different from them. That way they don’t have to worry about forcing their
views on anyone. It should be apparent that both of these approaches rest on
the assumption that contact between people who are different must result in a
missionary relationship, with one converting the other. The idea of mutual
influence, of organizing as building relationships with people rather than
organizing as recruiting people, is generally absent.

In my view, the largest problem shared by both the insurrectionary and
organizational camp, and most other anarchists, is whiteness: and even more
than the failure of white anarchists to solve the mystifying problem of
checking our white privilege, I mean intentionally preserving a movement
narrative that tells the stories and contains the values of white people, and
refusing to recognize the importance of white supremacy as a system of
oppression every bit as important as the state, capitalism, or patriarchy.

Different white anarchists find different ways of minimizing race, depending
on their analysis. But a common thread seems to be that perennial colonial
belief that for salvation — or hell, just for us to get along, the Other must
become like me. On the one hand, this could be the insistence that white
supremacy is nothing but a tool and invention of capitalism, perfectly
explainable in economic terms, and that for people of color to liberate
themselves, they must surrender whatever particular experience and history the
world’s ever present reaction to their skin color may have given them, and
identify primarily as workers, with nothing but fictive barriers standing
between them and the white anarchists sitting in their union halls waiting for
a little diversity to wander in. The minimization of race can also mask itself
behind a misuse of the recognition that race is an invention without
physiological justification. I’ve heard many anarchists take this further to
say that race does not exist. I imagine this could come as a slap in the face
to a great many of the world’s people, it certainly contradicts my own lived
experiences, and it is also a supremely idiotic statement. By definition
something that does not exist cannot cause results in the real world. I think
most anarchists who make this statement would be horrified by someone who
denied the existence of racism, but they must be using another kind of denial,
that which accompanies abusive relations, to not see this is exactly what they
have just done. (Other anarchists take a more dishonest but unassailable route
by simple denouncing as “identity politics” any excessive preoccupation with
race). Race is a harmful categorization that must be abolished, and like
capitalism or the state it cannot be wished away or solved by exclusion from
one’s analysis any more than AIDS or the scars of a beating can be wished
away. The liberal “color blind” mentality to which so many anarchists adhere
can only be a way of prolonging white supremacy.

Until white anarchists of all stripes allow — no, encourage — anarchism to
adapt to non-white stories, anarchism is likely to remain about as relevant to
most people of color as voting is to immigrants. And as long as anarchists
continue to view differences in the same way the state and civilization we
oppose has taught us to, we will never encompass the breadth of perspective
and participation we need to win.

## Comments on a couple articles from each side of the schism

The two insurrectionist essays I’ll touch on are “Rogues Against the State” by
crudo[^1] from Modesto Anarchist (California), and “Fire at Midnight,
Destruction at Dawn: Sabotage and Social War”[^2] from A Murder of Crows, out
of Seattle. Both of these are well written, thoughtful pieces, and neither in
itself is terribly sectarian. But they both contain weaknesses, and I think
they both could have been more useful if they had not set themselves in
opposition to another way of doing things.

“Fire at Midnight” advocates sabotage carried out inside of or outside of
social struggles, without spending much time criticizing other methods.
However, the article makes it clear that “We must be willing to examine and
scrutinize the methods and strategies of the past so that we do not follow in
the footsteps of history’s failed attempts at revolution. To this end we will
focus on a method that is as powerful as it is easy to put into practice:
sabotage.” However, it does not really discuss how to build the social
struggles they acknowledge are necessary for the total abolition of
capitalism, and I think most readers would get the impression that sabotage
itself is meant to build up such a struggle. Towards the end the article does
criticize more organized forms of resistance, though it chooses its targets
carefully, in a way that borders on setting up a strawman argument because the
effect is that one must either be part of a vanguard party, an
institutionalized group that always counsels waiting, or one must take part in
autonomous and anonymous, insurrectionary tactics like sabotage. To the
author, nothing in the middle is worth mentioning.

The effectiveness of sabotage is exaggerated. In fact, in most of the examples
mentioned in the article, the people using sabotage lose (though it almost
seems they are celebrated for maintaining a sort of purity throughout the
process). Let’s look at two of the cases where people won. One is the campaign
against Shell Oil and its involvement with South African apartheid. The
article points out that anonymous acts of sabotage throughout Europe and North
America against Shell cost them much more money than the boycott did. This is
an important fact that demonstrates the effectiveness of sabotage and the
silliness of those people who still claim violence (property destruction)
hurts the movement, but not when it is presented as a substitute for the
boycott. Generally, I am averse to boycotts because they reinforce our role as
consumers, but they go along well with education campaigns about, in this
case, the need to oppose Shell Oil. They are easy for everyone to do, and
harmless to the movement as long as pacifists don’t try to hold them up as an
effective alternative to violence. This article certainly appreciates the
easiness and replicability of tactics, when it comes to sabotage. The same
should apply to the education/boycott campaign because in many ways this
campaign provided a foundation for the wave of sabotage. Of course sabotage is
more effective, but destroying Shell Oil’s infrastructure and kidnapping their
executives would have been more effective still. That’s a moot point, because
the movement wasn’t strong enough to do this. Its strength needed to be built
up, just as it needed to be built up before a large wave of sabotage could
occur. By disdaining this building process, insurrectionists would be
destroying their own base. By embracing a building process, anarchists could
influence the creation of an education campaign based not on values of liberal
citizenship but on anticapitalist rage, surely a more supportive foundation
for sabotage and other forceful tactics.

The second example comes from the Mohawk (sic) who resisted Canadian
government encroachments at Oka in 1990. Sabotage was a strong tactic in this
struggle, but far more important was that resistance was carried out by a well
organized group united by a common culture (and also willing and able to
escalate well beyond sabotage), and many of the external, non-Mohawk groups
giving solidarity were also formally organized. Additionally, in such
circumstances, the anonymous and spontaneous form of organization favored by
insurrectionists really disadvantages the type of communication and
accountability that are needed for effective, responsible solidarity actions
that don’t end up hurting the people you’re trying to help. Once again, an
exclusively insurrectionary approach would have been less effective and
probably self-isolating (especially given the inescapable reality that right
now most insurrectionary anarchists — most anarchists — are white, so a
strong, exclusively insurrectionist tendency at Oka would have come off as yet
another example of white people exploiting the struggles of people of color).

“Rogues Against the State” also comes close to building a strawman in its
critique of activism. Again, it’s a bit vague as to who are the targets of the
criticism, and in this haze a dichotomy is entrenched between insurrection,
which is advocated as the path anarchists should take, and forms of activism
that are inevitably reformist and based on getting people to join a specific
organization. The essay contains a number of good points — about the problems
with building “one monolithic anarchist organization,” that certain
technologies such as cellphones and computers require the intensive
exploitation of global sacrifice zones so anarchy cannot result from worker
control of the present infrastructure — and the section on “Creating
Autonomous Spaces” is especially valuable.

But there are also serious flaws. As I pointed out earlier, this strategy does
not address the fatal shortcomings that became apparent when it was put into
practice in Western Europe. Point 9 contains the important point that
anarchists can, do, and should learn from non-anarchist struggles, and that
“the masses” do not need to be taught how to act. Yet a number of examples are
misleading. In Oaxaca, much of the struggle grew from the strike of the
teachers’ union, and was helped along by APPO, the popular assembly (much as
this organization may later have had a pacifying effect, organizationalists
take note). In the countryside, a large, organized anarchist influence was
CIPO-RFM, the association of autonomous anarchist communities, with whom I
understand NEFAC (the Northeastern Federation of Anarchist-Communists) works.
And as for “rent-strikes,” another spontaneous occurrence praised in the
article, is the author aware of how many of these come out of tenants groups,
organized quite often by activists (inside or outside the buildings)? In other
words, the inspiring examples of insurrection do not bear out the strategy of
insurrectionism.

But a great part of the essay is a criticism of activism, and here is one of
the weakest parts. The author says much of her/his personal experience was
with an activist group the principal activity of which was to dole out charity
and try to get other people to join the group. Yeah, that sounds pretty
shitty. The assumption that everyone engaged in activism, community
organizing, whatever the hell you want to call it, is doing the same thing, is
equally lacking in depth. Instead of taking their failures as a sign that they
were doing a bad job in their chosen activities, ‘crudo’ instead jumps ship
and denounces activism wholesale. “Activism” is never defined, and it’s too
easy a term to use disparagingly — many articulate, not-so-active anarchists
do. But the author gives the example of Copwatch and Food Not Bombs. I’ve seen
examples of these groups that have been effective, examples that have been
ineffective, some that have been charity and some that have been empowering.
It depends a great deal, not surprisingly, in how you go about it, whether
your goals, strategy, and tactics line up, or if you’re just mimicking
something anarchists habitually do elsewhere. If it’s done well and in spite
of its weaknesses, activism can teach us how to talk to mainstream people
without hiding, or scaring them away with, our anarchist politics, it can help
us learn how other people see common problems and thus how we can better
communicate a radical critique of these problems, and sometimes even motivate
people to get off the couch and respond to their problems with direct action.
It can allow us to influence other people’s realities, when they see that
there are anarchists out there, and therefore the possibility of anarchy, and
that by working together and using direct action we can change the situations
most people are used to only watching on television. It’s a fucking tedious
process that rarely brings results quickly, and this has the advantage of
teaching us that in the concrete details of people’s everyday lives revolution
is neither quick nor easy, that simply overcoming this stifling alienation in
a single neighbourhood could take years. The built-in disadvantages are that
it’s too easy to burn out, lose hope, compromise your dreams, or fall into a
holding pattern of habitual, uninspired actions to spare oneself the energy it
takes to be constantly creative and effective, to keep attacking these walls
of alienation by leaving one’s comfort zone and talking to strangers. ‘crudo’
seems to have an unrealistic view of this process, though since s/he mentions
years of experience in an activist group, it may just be the failing of a
mistakenly simplistic paragraph. But it’s amazing that in an otherwise
intelligent article, the author would suggest wheatpasting flyers around town
calling for a general strike as an alternative to talking with AFL-CIO
leaders, as though these are the two logical options, as though either one of
them could actually accomplish anything. If it’s unrealistic to say that a
union will usher in the revolution, what is it to suggest that reading a flyer
will get people to launch an insurrection? In both cases, a whole lot more
creativity and patience are called for.

Point number 8 also displays an unrealistic understanding of the
insurrectionist strategy (along with the obnoxious suggestion, based on who
knows what, that anarchists who are activists seek compromise with authority
instead of complete social transformation). “To be against activism and for a
complete social transformation means that we desire the destruction of
hierarchal [sic] society and openly desire it’s [sic] abolition. We seek
anti-politics, meaning the rejection of representative forms of struggle and a
praxis of insurrectionary attack, or the use of actions which seek to destroy
any existence of the state and capital and allows for the self-organization of
revolt and life. This does not mean that people shouldn’t use activist
approaches from time to time (for instance organizing events to fundraise for
political prisoners). But in general we need to find a strategy that exists
outside of going from protest to protest and from issue to issue. We are in
the middle of a social war, not a disagreement between various sides that can
reach a compromise.”

Activism is a vague method, or a set of tactics, things like giving away free
food or organizing a fundraiser for prisoners. How does this at all suggest
activists must believe in compromise with the government? And how exactly does
the author imagine setting up autonomous spaces or fighting the state, if
activist approaches like fundraising for prisoners are only a part of the
picture “from time to time” (has the author ever been to an autonomous space
like those he advocates? In Greece and Spain for example, organizing
informational events and doing fundraisers are a large part of what they do).
Ultimately, crudo’s call for war is meaninglessly abstract, because it lacks
the understanding of what, practically, war entails.

Then there is the question of privilege. ‘crudo’ says “We need to act along
side and with the oppressed for we are of them…” This is another mixed bag of
nuts. For those of us anarchists who were born with racial, economic, or other
privilege, it is vital to recognize that this system is still poisonous for
us, we don’t want it, and we’re not fighting to save other people but for
ourselves, in solidarity with others. ‘crudo’ is clear about this. But there
is also a certain sleight of hand occurring in this article, and that is the
conflation of all oppressions. For the most part, crudo only mentions class:
“As those of the oppressed and excluded we must abolish class society and
work. This is our project.” ‘crudo’ subsequently identifies “we” as “proles”.
Near the end of the article, ‘crudo’ briefly acknowledges problems of gender
and race, and concedes that whites and blacks are not “in the exact same boat”
but this afterthought really does not contradict the overall minimization of
race contained in the article (in fact the very brief analysis of racism is
basically the complaint that race divides the working class, “pitting racial
groups against one another”). The author is surprisingly honest about the
problem with this perspective, but fails to correct it: “In the ‘glory days’
of anarchism, everyone was only oppressed by class (or at least, that’s mostly
what the white men tell us). The negatives of class society was simply that of
a physically impoverished existence (poverty, hunger, etc). However, modern
life is much more complicated than that. We have become alienated beyond (or
on top of) class.” It’s telling (hell it’s down right disturbing) that ‘crudo’
acknowledges the white supremacist nature of this analysis, and then carries
on with it anyway. We should be grateful, though, because most anarchists who
discourage any emphasis on race are more sophisticated at hiding their true
motivations.

The result of this is that ‘crudo’ has to remind readers, and presumably
him/herself, that we are oppressed too, and therefore we have license to
intervene in the struggles of all other oppressed people. I think the effect
on readers will be to encourage a kind of solidarity even worse than we have
been guilty of in the past, approaching the movements of people far more
oppressed than us (with more at stake and graver consequences for action) with
a strong sense of entitlement, seeing their struggles as our opportunities.

As for the organizationalists…

“An Anarchist Communist Strategy for Rural, Southern Appalachia,”[^3] by Randy
Lowens, written for Anarkismo.net. This article seems to come from a sincere
desire to increase the effectiveness of the movement against mountaintop
removal (MTR) coal-mining in Appalachia. The author points out how
eco-anarchists are an important part of this struggle but says they
intentionally isolate themselves from other Appalachians, and moreover their
strategy, centered around dramatic direct actions taken by people who operate
outside of the community groups also opposing MTR, isolates them further.
Randy suggests overcoming that isolation by increasing contact with and
spreading an anti-capitalist analysis among Appalachians, and joining the
organizations formed to oppose MTR, in order to subvert liberal leadership.
Many of those are decent ideas, but given the tone of the essay, I have to say
I strongly sympathized with a comment, counterproductive as it was, posted
below the article that read simply: “Stay the fuck out of the dirty south,
ideologues!” The author dusts off a strategy that seems not to have changed in
the hundred odd years of its existence — the stated purpose of the essay is to
“construct an analogy between the historical strategy of bringing a
revolutionary perspective into mass organizations, and doing so in the
particulars of the given place and time, Southern Appalachia in the early
21^st^ century.” The tone with which he talks about anarcho-primitivists in
one section is reminiscent of a liberal Catholic Church official during the
Inquisition. Essentially: despite their heresy, many of them are good people
and must be saved. The suggestion that the masses “are in dire need of a
revolutionary voice” also sounds missionary.

“Over time it became apparent to me, that our direct action scenarios were not
building links with the community at large.” Similar to ‘crudo’, Randy Lowens
suggests changing strategic tracks entirely, again in a way that doesn’t leave
one very hopeful about the results. His suggested strategy basically sounds
like infiltrating (“penetration” of) the reformist environmentalist and
community groups and turning them against the liberal leadership, as though
that will build better links with the community. As an indication of that
friendly anarchist-communist outlook just destined to win hearts in
Appalachia, the author refers to the membership in these organizations as
“more attractive terrain” for anarchists. And once again, the locals will be
required to adopt the imported analysis and identify their experiences
strictly with the class struggle. Remember, I have this image of someone
shouting over the bullhorn at the next protest, you are not fighting for your
homes, your mountains, or your personal well being: you are fighting for your
class! I’m not sure what Randy Lowens means by “fellow workers,” but many of
the people in the coal-mining regions of Appalachia are unemployed, many of
the most active anti-MTR organizers are grandmothers who rarely or never
worked a wage job, and those who jealously hold one of the few jobs actually
involved with destroying the mountains and getting the coal can be among the
most strident supporters of MTR.

But the greatest weakness of this essay by far is its preference for a vague
affiliation with the tried-n-true anarchist-communist strategy over any actual
strategizing itself. After the analysis of the situation, the reader finally
gets to the section entitled “A Strategy for Rural, Southern Appalachian
Anarchists” hoping to find some intelligent or at least provocative
suggestions for how to radicalize the anti-MTR movement and better connect
with (other) Appalachians, only to find that this section is basically the
conclusion of the article, with a one line overview of what Malatesta said a
hundred years ago, little else of substance, and no details. Need it be said
that strategies are best derived from the specific situation one faces? A
problem with anarchist-communism, or insurrectionism for that matter, is that
at least in their usage by many people these come with pre-packaged strategies
that spare their affiliates from any hard thinking about what might actually
work in the conditions one is dealing with.

Notes on the article “Anarchism, Insurrections, and Insurrectionism”[^4] by
José Antonio Gutiérrez D.

This article is a response to, and something of an expansion on Joe Black’s
“Anarchism, Insurrections, and Insurrectionism”[^5] posted on the website of
the Workers’ Solidarity Movement, an anarchist-communist group in Ireland.
José praises Joe Black’s article, which is a respectful criticism of
insurrectionists, but says the latter only deals with the tactics and
organizational forms of the insurrectionists and ignores the “basic political
differences”. (Accordingly I will also bring up a few points Joe Black makes
about organization, since this article seems to accept those points).

After the necessary introductions, the article starts out: “To understand the
problem at the root of insurrectionalism’s political conceptions
(fundamentally wrong, in my opinion) we have to take into account that they
are the offspring of a certain historical moment…” This seems to be a typical
anarchist-communist approach, and while obviously history can be elucidating,
it can also be obfuscating, and in the course of this article it is primarily
the latter. Quite unfairly, the author doesn’t deal with actual
insurrectionists today, but talks mostly about times in the past when an
insurrectionary tendency has reared its ugly head, and he doesn’t even do much
to convince the reader the insurrectionists of today and yesterday have
anything in common besides the name, which in many cases they hardly do. I’d
say it’s a manipulative argument but I think the author is sincerely wrapped
up in the narrow and dogmatic historicism common to the dialectical and
reductively materialist. It seems to me that many anarchist-communists
compulsively go to the past to understand, or avoid, present situations, and I
guess this has to do with their Marxist heritage and their particular
subculture, which seems to favor debates and documents long since dead over
innovation or theoretical flexibility.

That said, it also doesn’t help that the historical analysis of this article,
and the facts it pretends to be based on, are flawed (though because of the
obscurantism that goes along with treating history like gospel, most people
would probably be fooled, and this is another point in favor of the
“emotional” insurrectionist “immediatism” that the author criticizes).

The historical rule the author is intent on constructing is that
insurrectionism is a peculiar product of historical periods with high levels
of repression and low levels of popular struggle. This assertion does not
stand up to the facts. The first example given, “propaganda by the deed,” may
or may not have arisen out of the repression of the Paris Commune as he says,
but it was carried out across Europe and in North and South America throughout
the next decades, at times of low or high repression, low or high popular
struggle. In the US for example, the Galleanists carried out their bombing
campaigns during a period of high repression, but they had started these
bombings while the popular struggles were still at a high level. Terrorism in
Russia did not follow the 1905 revolution (the author’s second example), it
was a major part of that revolution, and it was well developed before the
repression began, when there was a high level of popular struggle. This
insurrectionary activity was part of the struggle, largely carried out by
workers. Industrial workers, peasants, poor people, and many Jewish people
formed Byeznachalie and Chernoznamets groups that stole from the rich, bombed
police stations and bourgeois meeting points, and so on (and nearly all of
these were anarchist-communists, opposed primarily by the Kropotkinist
anarchist-communists in exile or by the anarcho-syndicalists). José leaves out
insurrectionism in Spain in the 1930s, at the very height of the popular
struggle and occurring in periods of high and low repression — in Spain most
clearly, the insurrectionists proved themselves to be more insightful than the
CNT bureaucrats who always advised waiting and negotiation. And he mentions
insurrectionism in Greece in the ’60s, but ignores its much more important
incarnations today, where it is quite at home in the high popular struggle of
the student movement, and set against a state repression that cannot be
characterized as particularly high.

Gutiérrez provides a good criticism that an increased reliance on
insurrectionary tactics can come as a response to isolation. This is very
true, but trying to make a historical rule out of it is sophomoric. Another
humorous example of reductionism: “the social-democracy consolidated in the
moment of low level of struggles after the Paris Commune, renouncing to
revolution and putting forward a reform by stages approach as their strategy.
For them, the moment of low confrontation was the historical rule — this is
the main reason to their opportunism.” Oh, so that’s why!

Elsewhere in the article the author strikes another low blow: “Also, the
moments of a low level of popular struggle generally happen after high levels
of class confrontation, so the militants still have lingering memories of the
‘barricade days’. These moments are frozen in the minds of the militants and
it is often that they try to capture them again by trying hard, by an exercise
of will alone, by carrying on actions in order to ‘awaken the masses’… most of
the times, these actions have the opposite result to the one expected and end
up, against the will of its perpetrators, serving in the hands of repression.”
Saying clandestine actions serve the repression sounds like pacifism and it
completely misunderstands the nature of the state, which will manufacture
excuses for repression as needed (e.g. the Dog Soldier Teletypes used against
AIM). The only thing that justifies repression is other radicals who backstab
those using different tactics rather than helping to explain those tactics to
the masses with whom they’re supposedly in touch. If a population is pacified
enough, indoctrinated enough by state propaganda, going on strike or even
joining a union can be popularly seen as justification for repression.
Anarchists should recognize there is no natural threshold of action beyond
which people will automatically see repression as justified.

Gutiérrez also makes a point about insurrectionists doing the work of
provocateurs, but this point is overplayed and ultimately pacifying.
Provocateurs encourage stupid actions to hurt a movement or allow them to
neutralize some key organizers, but they never wait for such excuses (for
example they assassinated Black Panther Fred Hampton even though he never took
the bait suggested by the infilitrator). And more often, the government
encourages passivity, waiting, issuing demands, negotiating, operating in
formal, above-ground organizations that are basically like a snatch-squad’s
goody bag if heavy repression is ever needed (I discuss this at greater length
in ‘How Nonviolence Protects the State’). But insurrectionists in small
affinity groups are better prepared to discuss, evaluate and plan clandestine
and aggressive direct actions in an intelligent manner (i.e. one that does not
at all serve state interests) than are organizationalists, because the former
tend to take better security precautions and their structures are far more
intelligently designed when it comes to surviving repression. José Antonio
Gutiérrez not only misses the mark, he presents his point in an exceedingly
disgusting fashion, that “irresponsible or untimely action of sincere
comrades” is more dangerous than the conniving of government provocateurs.
This divisive, heavy-handed denunciation is tantamount to the backstabbing
obstructionism vanguardist groups always bring to bear on those who act
without their permission (for example, the Trotskyists who always said the
actions of the Red Brigades, or the Angry Brigade, were the work of
fascist/state provocateurs, or the similar people who said the same thing
about the recent rocket attack on the US Embassy in Greece). It’s even worse
that the article provides no examples of such “irresponsible” action. By being
vague, the author covers himself from criticisms of “blanket” denunciations
like the same kind he faults insurrectionists for using, but the result of his
caution is to feed into an abstracted, stereotypical image of irresponsible
insurrectionists that is neither respectful, productive, nor, it would seem,
with much factual basis.

José dismisses the potentially useful criticism coming from insurrectionists,
saying instead that insurrectionism is useful because it mirrors all the
weaknesses in the anarchist movement, so it’s like a clear illness to be
cured. Little if any insurrectionist criticism is dealt with fairly (instead
of quoting insurrectionist criticisms, the author tends to rely on generalized
notions of such criticisms).

Here’s a related example: “Another huge problem in discussion among anarchists
is the use of blanket concepts, as demonstrated by comrade Black, that in fact
help more to obscure than to clarify debate. For instance, it is too often
that “unions” are criticised as if all of them were exactly the same thing…
ignoring the world of difference between, let’s say, the IWW, the maquilas
unions or the AFL-CIO in the US. To group them all under the same category not
only doesn’t help the debate, but it is also a gross mistake that reveals an
appalling political and conceptual weakness.”

Well, it’s interesting to note that in the “Aims and Principles” of the
Anarchist-Communist Federation (1995 edition), point number seven begins
“Unions by their very nature cannot be the vehicles for the revolutionary
transformation of society” and later clarifies that “even syndicalist unions”
are also subject to this “fundamental” nature.

Elsewhere, Gutiérrez says “the very criticism made by insurrectionalists can
work as a godsend for [the] State to justify repression.” The example the
author uses is of a Mexican anarchist group that apparently criticized APPO
and CIPO-RFM in Oaxaca, during the state repression. The suggestion that
insurrectionist criticism helps the state is heavy-handed and, no matter what
the author may say or intend, fosters an air of silence and, ultimately,
exactly the kind of authoritarianism insurrectionists have validly warned
against. I have not read the criticism put out by the Informal Anarchist
Coordination of Mexico that is referred to, and I don’t know if it is
respectful and accurate or not (though I have read a few other criticisms of
APPO developing a reformist, conciliatory character towards the end), but the
argument that it was untimely creates an attitude against criticism when
criticism is needed most. I suppose in the autumn of 1936 in Catalonia, to
beat a dead horse, criticism was also untimely, but that was when the CNT-FAI
really needed to be set straight, the point of high pressure when mass
organizations and representative organizations are most likely to sell out.

He makes a sometimes fair point that insurrectionists are constructing an
ideology around a preference for a single tactic (though if the author has
read any of the better insurrectionary writings he must not have understood
[perhaps they didn’t mention class enough] that they were very insightfully
creating ideologies or theories out of analysis and contact with reality far
more than I think any anarchist-communist has done since before World War II).
But the author says insurrectionists are ineffective because they are
functionally incapable of evaluating tactics due to their informal
organization. The suggestion that you need a “programme” “to measure the
effectiveness of the actions” comes out of left field without any
justification (similar to the assumption that you need to identify with your
class in order to understand your oppression), and I’m left with the image of
a particularly dogmatic third-grader who insists all solemn-eyed that without
your multiplication table in hand it is impossible to know what two times
seven equals.

I’ve saved his best point for last: “Revolutionaries, above all, have to learn
the art of perseverance. Impatience is not a good adviser as taught by
revolutionary experience. This does not mean to wait, but to know how to
choose the type of actions to perpetrate in certain moments.” As boring and
wooden as organizationalists may sometimes be, I think many insurrectionists
overplay the liberatory potential of fun. Granted, you can’t really describe
how liberating play can be if you write in as boring a way as, for example, I
do, weighing the pros and cons and blabbering away for, Christ, sixteen pages
already?? I don’t have a problem with “Armed Joy,” to name one, but if this is
the only thing you read your strategy and expectations of revolution will be
sorely handicapped. I agree with the insurrectionist caution against sacrifice
insofar as the Chairman Mao figures typically advocating it have all been
frauds in the past, but as much as we can empower ourselves here and now we
really can’t totally determine the character of the revolution, and the state
sure as hell has the power to make sure it won’t be fun. A preference for fun
too easily becomes a preference for comfort, and revolution is not
comfortable. It occurs to me that an exclusive emphasis on attack, on action
now, and the impatience that sometimes goes with that, leads to
revolutionaries who cannot swallow the consequences of their actions. As an
example I would name the ELF, and how quickly most of them rolled over and
began to cooperate with the state once they were caught.

There are a few points from Joe Black’s original article that also need
addressing, and most relevant is his defense of formal organization. “Far from
developing hierarchy, our constitutions not only forbid formal hierarchy but
contain provisions designed to prevent the development of informal hierarchy
as well. For instance considerable informal power can fall to someone who is
the only one who can do a particular task and who manages to hold onto this
role for many years. So the WSM constitution says no member can hold any
particular position for more than three years. After that time they have to
step down.” However, constitutions are not power. The paradox is that what’s
written on paper actually means nothing to the functioning of bureaucratic
organizations, and if some people haven’t digested that fact yet it’s about as
safe for them to work in a large, formal organization as it is to put a
seeing-impaired two-year-old behind the wheel of a five-ton tractor. The CNT
joined the government in Spain in 1936 in a procedure that violated its
constitution, to refer again to that sacred font of historical anarchist
examples. Structure is only part of the equation, and power-sharing structures
can easily be subverted if the group culture is not also fervently
anti-hierarchical. A criticism by insurrectionists which is valid in at least
some instances is that organizations with formal constitutions and elected,
specialized positions tend towards a rigidity and stagnation that invites the
development of hierarchy. I personally don’t think such groups should be off
limits. It’s clear that both suggested forms of organization have their
weaknesses, and informal organizations are certainly vulnerable to informal
hierarchies, but I think Joe Black has missed the substance of the criticism
that, when apprehended, could hold the weaknesses of formal organizations in
check.

I also want to point out the falsehood in the following: “Anarchist communism
was clarified in 1926 by a group of revolutionary exiles analysing why their
efforts to date had failed. This resulted in the publication of the document
known in English as the ‘Organisational Platform of the Libertarian
Communists’ which we have analysed at length elsewhere.” This is misleading —
most anarchist-communists opposed the Platform. I honestly don’t have an
absolute problem with folks who want a platform to clarify their efforts and
basic beliefs, although I don’t think I could ever limit myself to a few
points on paper, but this suppression of disagreement evident in Joe Black’s
historical cherry picking certainly mirrors the conformity that will accompany
a platform unless its authors are careful, conscious, and well meaning.

Since it looks like that time to slop together some kind of conclusion, I’ll
say that I suppose I don’t believe the structures or forms of voluntary
organization we adopt act deterministically to control our outcomes (though
they have a strong influence, as all tools do, on the wielder) but all the
structures and strategies developed by anarchists so far have serious
weaknesses, and these flaws will be fatal unless we are more honest, flexible,
receptive to criticism, and energetic than we have been to date.
