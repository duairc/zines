## Synopsis

![The other civil rights movement.](images/oakland/14.jpg)

This pamphlet – written collaboratively by a group of people of color, women,
and queers – is offered in deep solidarity and in the spirit of conversation
with anyone committed to ending oppression and exploitation materially. It is
a critique of how privilege theory and cultural essentialism have
incapacitated antiracist, feminist, and queer organizing in this country by
confusing identity categories with culture, and culture with solidarity. This
conflation, we go on to argue, minimizes and misrepresents the severity and
structural character of the violence and material deprivation faced by
marginalized demographics.

According to this politics, white supremacy is primarily a psychological
attitude which individuals can simply choose to discard instead of a material
infrastructure which reproduces race at key sites across society – from
racially segmented labor markets to the militarization of the border. Even
when this material infrastructure is named, more confrontational tactics which
might involve the risk of arrest are deemed “white” and “privileged,” while
the focus turns back to reforming the behavior and beliefs of individuals.
Privilege politics is ultimately rooted in an idealist theory of power which
maintains that psychological attitudes are the root cause of oppression and
exploitation, and that vague alterations in consciousness will somehow remake
oppressive structures.

This dominant form of anti-oppression politics also assumes that demographic
categories are coherent, homogeneous “communities” or “cultures.” This
pamphlet argues that identity categories do not indicate political unity or
agreement. Identity is not solidarity. The violent domination and
subordination we face on the basis of our race, gender, and sexuality do not
immediately create a shared political vision. But the uneven impact of
oppression across society creates the conditions for the diffuse emergence of
autonomous groups organizing on the basis of common experiences, analysis, and
tactics. There is a difference between a politics which places shared cultural
identity at the center of its analysis of oppression, and autonomous
organizing against forms of oppression which impact members of marginalized
groups unevenly.

This pamphlet argues that demands for increased cultural sensitivity and
recognition has utterly failed to stop a rising tide of bigotry and violence
in an age of deep austerity. Anti-oppression, civil rights, and decolonization
struggles repeatedly demonstrate that if resistance is even slightly
effective, the people who struggle are in danger. The choice is not between
danger and safety, but between the uncertain dangers of revolt and the
certainty of continued violence, deprivation, and death. There is no middle
ground.

## I. The Non-Negotiable Necessity of Autonomous Organizing

As a group of people of color, women, queers, and poor people coming together
to attack a complex matrix of oppression and exploitation, we believe in the
absolute necessity of autonomous organizing. By “autonomous” we mean the
formation of independent groups of people who face specific forms of
exploitation and oppression – including but not limited to people of color,
women, queers, trans\* people, gender nonconforming people, QPOC. We also
believe in the political value of organizing in ways which try to cross
racial, gender, and sexual divisions. We are neither spokespersons for Occupy
Oakland nor do we think a single group can possibly speak to the variety of
challenges facing different constituencies.

We hope for the diffuse emergence of widespread autonomous organizing. We
believe that a future beyond capital’s 500 year emergence through enclosures
of common land, and the enslavement, colonization, and genocide of
non-European populations – and beyond the 7000 or more years of violent
patriarchal structuring of society along hierarchized and increasingly binary
gender lines – will require revolutions within revolutions. Capitalism’s
ecocidal destiny, and its relentless global production of poverty, misery,
abuse, and disposable and enslavable populations, will force catastrophic
social change within most of our lifetimes – whether the public actively
pursues it or not.

No demographic category of people could possibly share an identical set of
political beliefs, cultural identities, or personal values. Accounts of
racial, gender, and sexual oppression as “intersectional” continue to treat
identity categories as coherent communities with shared values and ways of
knowing the world. No individual or organization can speak for people of
color, women, the world’s colonized populations, workers, or any demographic
category as a whole – although activists of color, female and queer activists,
and labor activists from the Global North routinely and arrogantly claim this
right. These “representatives” and institutions speak on behalf of social
categories which are not, in fact, communities of shared opinion. This
representational politics tends to eradicate any space for political
disagreement between individuals subsumed under *the same* identity
categories.

We are interested in exploring the question of the relationship between
identity-based oppression and capitalism, and conscious of the fact that the
few existing attempts to synthesize these two vastly different political
discourses leave us with far more questions than answers. More recent attempts
to come to terms with this split between anti-oppression and anticapitalist
politics, in insurrectionary anarchism for example, typically rely on
simplistic forms of race and gender critique which typically begin and end
with the police. According to this political current, the street is a place
where deep and entrenched social differences can be momentarily overcome. We
think this analysis deeply underestimates the qualitative differences between
specific forms and sites of oppression and the variety of tactics needed to
address these different situations.

Finally, we completely reject a vulgar “class first” politics which argues
that racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia are simply “secondary to” or
“derivative of” economic exploitation. The prevalence of racism in the US is
not a clever conspiracy hatched by a handful of ruling elites but from the
start has been a durable racial contract between two unequal parties. The US
is a white supremacist nation indelibly marked by the legal construction of
the “white race” in the 1600s through the formation of a cross-class alliance
between a wealthy planter class and poor white indentured servants. W.E.B. Du
Bois called the legal privileges accorded to poor whites a “psychological
wage”: “It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they
received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and
psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy
because they were white. They were admitted freely with all classes of white
people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools. The police
were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent upon their votes,
treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness. Their vote
selected public officials, and while this had small effect upon the economic
situation, it had great effect upon their personal treatment and the deference
shown to them.”

We live in the shadow of this choice and this history. A history which is far
from over.

## II. Institutional Struggles Over the Meaning of Anti-Oppression Politics

### a. On the Non-Profit Industrial Complex (NPIC), Again

Nonprofits exist to maintain society as we know it. Nonprofits often provide
vital social services in the spaces left by the state’s retreat from postwar
welfare provisions, services which keep women, queers, and trans people,
particularly those who are poor and of color, alive. Post-WWII welfare
provisions themselves were provided primarily to white families – through
redlining or the racially exclusive postwar GI Bill for example. Social
justice nonprofits in particular exist to co-opt and quell anger, preempt
racial conflict, and validate a racist, patriarchal state. These organizations
are often funded by business monopolies which have profited from and
campaigned for the privatization of public social services. This has been
argued extensively by many who have experienced the limits of nonprofit work
firsthand, most recently by INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence.

Indeed, the exponential growth of NGOs and nonprofits could be understood as
the 21st century public face of counterinsurgency, except this time speaking
the language of civil, women’s, and gay rights, charged with preempting
political conflict, and spiritually committed to promoting one-sided
“dialogue” with armed state bureaucracies. Over the last four decades, a
massive nonprofit infrastructure has evolved in order to prevent, whether
through force or persuasion, another outbreak of the urban riots and
rebellions which spread through northern ghettos in the mid to late 1960s.
Both liberal and conservative think tanks and service providers have arisen
primarily in response to previous generations of radical Black, Native
American, Asian American, and Chican@ Third World Liberation movements. In the
21st century, social justice activism has become a professional career path.
Racial justice nonprofits, and an entire institutionally funded activist
infrastructure, partner with the state to echo the rhetoric of past movements
for liberation while implicitly or explicitly condemning their militant
tactics.

The material infrastructure promoting these ideas is massive, enabling their
extensive dissemination and adoption. Largely funded by philanthropic
organizations like the Ford Foundation ($13.7 billion), Rockefeller Foundation
($3.1 billion), or the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($37.1 billion), the US
nonprofit sector has grown exponentially, often through the direct
privatization of the remnants of America’s New Deal-era social safety net.
This funding structure ties liberal organizations charged with representing
and serving communities of color to businesses interested primarily in
taxexemptions and charity, and completely hostile to radical social
transformation despite their rhetoric. In 2009 nonprofits accounted for 9% of
all wages and salaries paid in the United States, generated $1.41 trillion in
total revenues, and reported $2.56 trillion in total assets. One need only
hear the names of these philanthropic organizations to realize that they are
or were some of the largest business monopolies in the world, whose
foundations are required to donate 5% of their endowment each year, while 95%
of the remaining funds remain invested in financial markets. The public is
asked to thank these organizations for their generosity for solving problems
which they are literally invested in maintaining.

### b. Politicians and Police Who Are “Just Like Us”

In California some of the most racist policies and “reforms” in recent history
have been advanced by politicians of color. We are not interested in
increasing racial, gender, and sexual diversity within existing hierarchies of
power – within government, police forces, or in the boardrooms of corporate
America. When police departments and municipal governments can boast of their
diversity and multicultural credentials, we know that there needs to be a
radical alternative to this politics of “inclusion.” Oakland is perhaps one of
the most glaring examples of how people of color have not just participated in
but in many instances led – as mayors, police chiefs, and city council members
– the assault on poor and working class black and brown populations. Oakland
Mayor Jean Quan speaks the language of social justice activism and civil
rights but her political career in city government clearly depends upon
satisfying right-wing downtown business interests, corrupt real estate
speculators, and a bloated and notoriously brutal police force.

There is no more depressing cautionary tale of the fate of 1960s-era politics
of “changing the state from within” than the career of Oakland Mayor Quan.
Quan fought for the creation of an Ethnic Studies program at UC Berkeley in
1969, and in 2011 penned a letter to Occupy Oakland listing an array of
state-approved social justice nonprofits in order to justify mass arrests and
a police crackdown on protesters attempting to establish a community center
and free clinic in a long abandoned city owned property.[^1] In response to a
season of strikes, anti-police brutality marches, and repeated port shutdowns
in response to police assaults, the state offered two choices: either the
nonprofits, or the police.

![Mayor Quan surveys the aftermath of City Hall vandalism on January 28
Move-In Day.](images/oakland/13.jpg)

Quan and other municipal politicians are part of a state apparatus that is
rapidly increasing its reliance upon militarized policing to control an unruly
population, especially poor people of color in urban areas. Policing is fast
becoming the paradigm for government in general. A white supremacist
decades-long “war on drugs” has culminated in a 21st century imperial “war on
terror.” The equipment and tactics of “urban pacification” are now being
turned on American cities and on the citizens and non-citizens who are
targeted by austerity measures which have for decades been applied to the
Global South.

This is as much the case in the liberal Bay Area as it is anywhere else.
Recently “Urban Shield 2011,” a series of urban military training exercises
for Bay Area police forces, was held on the campus of UC Berkeley in
anticipation of raids on the Occupy Oakland encampment and other local
occupied public parks. Israeli Border Police and military police from Bahrain,
fresh from suppressing an Arab Spring uprising in their own country, took part
in these exercises beside Alameda County Sheriffs and Oakland Police
Department officers.

We see clearly that in an era of deepening budget cuts and America’s global
decline, the white liberal consensus about racial inclusion is quickly
becoming economically unaffordable, and in its place we see increasingly
widespread public support for mainstream, openly white supremacist social
movements. Armed paramilitary white nationalist organizations like the
Minutemen patrol the US border, white supremacist media figures spout
genocidal fantasies on the radio and television, and police killings of young
black men and women have become so frequent that even the mainstream media has
begun to report on it. At the same time, policing is fast becoming the
paradigm for government in general.

### c. Capitalism and the Material Reproduction of “Race” and “Gender”

Establishing community mutual aid and self-defense against the violence of
emergent mainstream racist movements, against the systematic rape and
exploitation of women, and against the systematic murder and/or economic
ostracization of transgender, transsexual, and gender-nonconforming people;
attacking ICE and police-enforced austerity policies which have historically
targeted communities of color, naming and resisting the rollbacks of
reproductive rights and access to healthcare as the patriarchal, racist
attacks that they truly are; these are some of the major challenges facing all
of us who understand that oppression is inextricable from global capitalist
crisis. We cannot separate what’s happening in Oakland from a global wave of
anti-austerity and anti-police brutality general strikes, occupations, and
riots across the globe – from Barcelona to Tottenham, from Tahrir to Mali, and
from Bhopal to Johannesburg.

![March 29, 2012 general strike in Spain.](images/oakland/1.jpg)

We do not believe that autonomous groups will be able to sustain themselves
without creating non-state based support networks and without recognizing the
mutual implication of white supremacy with capitalism and patriarchy.
Undocumented immigrants confront a vicious, coordinated, and entirely
mainstream ICE, police, and civilian assault which is, to be absolutely clear,
a nativist anti-Latin@ movement committed to patrolling the borders of a
nation understood as fundamentally white. Intensifying anti-immigrant racism
is not unrelated to capitalism, and just a national but an international
phenomenon, fueled by the success of capitalist globalization, by the profits
which could be realized through debt and structural adjustment programs, US
agribusiness subsidies, “free trade” agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA, and
through multinational industries inevitably searching for lower labor costs
through the fragmentation of global supply chains. Austerity means women, and
particularly poor black and brown women, are being forced by the state and
their husbands, boyfriends, and fathers to make up for the cuts in services
and wages through additional domestic and reproductive labor they have always
performed.

As a recent W.A.T.C.H. communique from Baltimore puts it, “We know that
economic crises mean more domestic labor, and more domestic labor means more
work for women. Dreams of a ‘mancession’ fade quickly when one realizes
male-dominated sectors are simply the first to feel a crisis – and the first
to receive bailout funds. The politics of crisis adds to the insult of
scapegoating the injury of unemployment and unwaged overwork. And the
nightmare of fertility politics, the ugly justification of welfare and social
security ‘reforms.’ ‘Saving America’s families,’ the culture war rhetoric that
clings to heteronormativity, to patriarchy, in the face of economic meltdown.
Crisis translates politically to putting women in their place, while demanding
queers and trans people pass or else. And the worse this crisis gets, the more
the crisis is excused by a fiction of scarcity, the more the family will be
used to promote white supremacy by assaulting women’s autonomy under the guise
of population control. The old Malthusian line: it’s not a crisis, there’s
just not enough – for them.”

Capitalism can neither be reduced to the “predatory practices of Wall Street
banks” nor is it something which “intersects” with race, gender, and sexual
oppression. Capitalism is a system based on a gendered and racialized division
of labor, resources, and suffering. Violence and deprivation, premature death,
and rape, are structural aspects of an economic system which requires that
some work and some do not, some receive care and some do not, some survive,
and some die. To say that poor people of color, queers, or immigrants are not
interested or not profoundly impacted by the economy, and instead interested
only in reaffirming their identities within existing hierarchies of power, is
to work within a rigged zero-sum game for the liberation of a particular
oppressed identity at the expense of all the others. In the US in particular,
the celebration of cultural diversity, the recognition of cultural difference,
the applauding of women and queers entering the workplace, and the relative
decline of overtly racist or sexist beliefs among younger generations, has not
improved but instead masked a dramatic deterioration of the material
circumstances of racialized populations.

Massive accumulation through dispossession of native lands; racialized
enslavement, murder, and incarceration; constant, intimate, and intensive
exploitation of women’s unpaid labor, both in the home and as indentured
domestic work, and always violently stratified according to race — all of
these form the naturalized and invisibilized underbelly of capital’s waged
exploitation of workers. The cumulative economic impact of centuries of
enslavement, genocide, colonialism, patriarchy, and racial segregation is not
simply peripheral but integral and fundamental to the nature of the global
capitalist economy.

The US economy reproduces racial, gender, and sexual inequality at every level
of American society–in housing, healthcare, food sovereignty, education,
policing, and prison. And also endlessly recreated in these very same sites
are the categories “man/woman,” “normal/abnormal,” “able/disabled,”
“legitimate/illegitimate,” “citizen/‘illegal,’” and a series of stigmatized
populations who always interfere with the smooth functioning of the national
economy. The natural, “harmonious” relationship between citizens, patriots,
taxpayers, owners, workers, rich, and poor, are disrupted by “illegals,”
welfare queens, faggots, freaks, careless promiscuous teens, and so on. The
category of “race” is materially recreated and endlessly renewed through these
institutions which organize the lives of the undocumented, the imprisoned, the
residents of aging ghettos which increasingly function as open-air prisons.

Speaking of capitalism as though it were somehow separable from racist
exploitation, gendered violence, and the gamut of complex oppressions facing
us in this world, confines antiracist and antipatriarchal struggle to the
sphere of culture, consciousness, and individual privilege. The current
dominant form of anti-oppression politics in fact diminishes the extent to
which racialized and gendered inequalities are deepening across society
despite the generalization of policies promoting linguistic, cultural, gender,
and sexual inclusivity. Without attacking the material infrastructure which
agglomerates power in the hands of some (a process whose end result is now
called “privilege”), the equalization of “privilege” and the abolition of
these identity-based oppressions in class society is a liberal fantasy.

### d. The Racialization of Rape and the Erasure of Sexual Violence

Over the last year in California, the racist specter of potential rape has
been used to both delegitimize spaces of militant action – in parks, streets,
homes, or college campuses – and to erase the prevalence of sexual violence
throughout society. The figure of the black rapist is routinely invoked to
excuse police violence, retroactively justifying the murders of countless
black men like Kenneth Harding. The need to preempt potential rape has been
explicitly used to rationalize the widely publicized pepper spraying of UC
Davis students on November 18, 2011. We are tempted to say this incident is
more about the need for state bureaucracies to justify their own existence
than it does about epidemic of sexual violence in America, but the truth is
that the reality of rape and sexual violence along with rape’s deployment as
an ideological weapon are fundamental to the everyday functioning of the
economy and the state.

In recent interviews, UC Davis Chancellor Katehi and Vice Chancellor Meyer,
respectively, defend the police response to the Occupy UC Davis encampment by
invoking Occupy Oakland and the implicit threat of sexual violence from the
“outside.” Katehi claimed, “We were worried especially about having very young
girls and other students with older people who come from the outside without
any knowledge of their record … if anything happens to any student while we’re
in violation of policy, it’s a very tough thing to overcome.”[^2] Chancellor
Meyer was much more specific about the hypothetical threats in question: “So
my fear is a long-term occupation with a number of tents where we have an
undergraduate student and a non-affiliate and there is an incident. And then
I’m reporting to a parent that a non-affiliate has done this unthinkable act
with your daughter, and how could we let that happen.”[^3]

![Police crack down on the Occupy Davis encampment at UC
Davis.](images/oakland/3.jpg)

These statements illuminate how gender and race are typically linked in public
discourse – here, Katehi, a woman in a position of power attempting to justify
an illegal police action, infantilizes women as permanent victims and posits a
tacitly racist specter of the criminal rapist, coming from the “outside” to
the “inside” of the campus community. After the hypothetical rape, the rape
survivor disappears. The rape is regrettable; this regret is not articulated
in terms of the trauma of the rape survivor, but through the fact that the
incident will have to be reported to a parent. To say rape is “unthinkable” is
only possible from a position of privilege in which sexual violence is not an
everyday reality.

Considering the fact that rape occurs within every class and every possible
racial demographic, usually perpetrated by friends and family, it is utterly
fantastic to suggest that a large university campus like UC Davis is a place
where rapes do not occur and where rape culture doesn’t flourish. Rendering
rape unthinkable is absolutely essential to its structural use as a tool of
gendered subordination and exploitation, and also as an ideological tool of
white supremacy. The pepper spray incident reveals how the specter of rape
appears in state and media narratives when it’s politically useful, and
functions as a tool of racialization and criminalization (two processes which
converge on poor black and brown populations) when in fact rape and sexual
violence affects every sector of society.

The locations which we are told to fear rape and sexual violence change
depending upon what is politically expedient, and it’s crucial to notice which
sites are emphasized and when – rape has occurred in Occupy encampments across
the country, but far, far more rapes have occurred in American households, and
yet media reports do not discourage us from heterosexual marriage and
co-habitation. When is rape ignorable, and when is it unacceptable? Rape
occurs frequently in dorm rooms, in fraternities and sororities, in cars, on
dates, amongst persons of like age, ethnicity, and class. When the exclusion
of police from public spaces is represented by the media as an invitation to
rape, we are not at the same time informed that police themselves rape,
sexually assault, and abuse women, trans people, queers, sex workers and
others with stomach-turning frequency.

While these administrators mobilize the specter of rape to defend the police
response to the Occupy encampment at UC Davis, they take part in a nationwide
campus culture that sanctions sexual violence. A major study on the topic
found that colleges only expel persons found responsible for sexual assault in
10-25 % of all reported cases. These students were often suspended for a
semester or received minor academic penalties. Half of the students
interviewed said that student judicial services found their alleged assailants
not responsible for sexual assault.[^4]

When sexual violence manifests in public organizing spaces, the subject is
routinely labeled “divisive” or “just personal”. In a disturbing feat of
capitulation to the state’s attack, ‘radicals’ will frequently suspect that
allegations of rape and sexual assault are in fact inventions of state forces
attempting to infiltrate communities of struggle. Many radical communities
have come to associate a focus on addressing and attacking sexual violence
with a politics of demobilization or distraction from the “real issues.”
Again, the result is that the reality of sexual violence, not merely in one
month encampments, but in personal spaces, amongst persons from every racial
and ethnic demographic who know and trust one another, is methodically erased.
The silence around sexual violence sanctions it, just as the spectacular
outrage at isolated incidents of racial violence (e.g. Trayvon Martin) marks
the everyday police murder of black and brown individuals as routine. The
reality of sexual violence is that it is silenced, evaded, and ignored,
empowering primarily cisgendered men at every level of society, and
transforming conversations about sexual violence into further justification
for intensified racist segregation, incarceration, and policing.

## III. The Limits of Contemporary Anti-Oppression Theory and Practice

### a. Identity is not Solidarity

Privilege theory and cultural essentialism have incapacitated antiracist,
feminist, and queer organizing in this country by confusing identity
categories with solidarity and reinforcing stereotypes about the political
homogeneity and helplessness of “communities of color.” The category of
“communities of color” is itself a recently invented identity category which
obscures the central role that antiblack racism plays in maintaining an
American racial order and conceals emerging forms of nonwhite interracial
conflict. What living in a “post-racial era” really means is that race is
increasingly represented in government, media, and education as “culture”
while the nation as a whole has returned to levels of racial inequality,
residential and educational segregation, and violence unseen since the last
“post-racial” moment in American history – the mid-60s legal repeal of the
apartheid system of Jim Crow.

Understanding racism as primarily a matter of individual racial privilege, and
the symbolic affirmation of marginalized cultural identities as the solution
to this basic lack of privilege, is the dominant and largely unquestioned form
of anti-oppression politics in the US today. According to this politics,
whiteness simply becomes one more “culture,” and white supremacy a
psychological attitude, instead of a structural position of dominance
reinforced through institutions, civilian and police violence, access to
resources, and the economy.

Demographic categories are not coherent, homogeneous “communities” or
“cultures” which can be represented by individuals. Identity categories do not
indicate political unity or agreement. Identity is not solidarity. Gender,
sexual, and economic domination within racial identity categories have
typically been described through an additive concept, intersectionality, which
continues to assume that political agreement is automatically generated
through the proliferation of existing demographic categories. Representing
significant political differences as differences in privilege or culture
places politics beyond critique, debate, and discussion.

For too long individual racial privilege has been taken to be the problem, and
state, corporate, or nonprofit managed racial and ethnic “cultural diversity”
within existing hierarchies of power imagined to be the solution. It is a
well-worn activist formula to point out that “representatives” of different
identity categories must be placed “front and center” in struggles against
racism, sexism, and homophobia. But this is meaningless without also
specifying the content of their politics. The US Army is simultaneously one of
the most racially integrated and oppressive institutions in American society.
“Diversity” alone is a meaningless political ideal which reifies culture,
defines agency as inclusion within oppressive systems, and equates identity
categories with political beliefs.

Time and again politicians of color have betrayed the very groups they claim
to represent while being held up as proof that America is indeed a
“colorblind” or “post-racial” society. Wealthy queers support initiatives
which lock up and murder poor queers, trans\* people, and sex workers. Women
in positions of power continue to defend and sometimes initiate the vicious
assault on abortion and reproductive rights, and then offload reproductive
labor onto the shoulders of care workers who are predominantly women of color.

But more pertinent for our argument is the phenomenon of anti-oppression
activists – who do advance a structural analysis of oppression and yet
consistently align themselves with a praxis that reduces the history of
violent and radically unsafe antislavery, anticolonial, antipatriarchal,
antihomophobic, and anticiscentric freedom struggles to struggles over
individual privilege and state recognition of cultural difference. Even when
these activists invoke a history of militant resistance and sacrifice, they
consistently fall back upon strategies of petitioning the powerful to renounce
their privilege or “allow” marginalized populations to lead resistance
struggles.

For too long there has been no alternative to this politics of privilege and
cultural recognition, and so rejecting this liberal political framework has
become synonymous with a refusal to seriously address racism, sexism, and
homophobia in general. Even and especially when people of color, women, and
queers imagine and execute alternatives to this liberal politics of cultural
inclusion, they are persistently attacked as white, male, and privileged by
the cohort that maintains and perpetuates the dominant praxis.

![After marching more than 1000 miles, protesters with disabilities confront
Bolivian riot police in La Paz, February 2012](images/oakland/5.jpg)

### b. Protecting Vulnerable Communities of Color and “Our” Women and Children: The Endangered Species Theory of Minority Populations and Patriarchal White Conservationism

The dominant praxis of contemporary anti-oppression politics relinquishes
power to political representatives and reinforces stereotypes of individually
“deserving” and “undeserving” victims of racism, sexism, and homophobia. A
vast nonprofit industrial complex, and a class of professional “community
spokespeople,” has arisen over the last several decades to define the
parameters of acceptable political action and debate. This politics of safety
must continually project an image of powerlessness and keep communities of
color, women, and queers “protected” and confined to speeches and mass rallies
rather than active disruption. For this politics of cultural affirmation,
suffering is legitimate and recognizable only when it conforms to white
middle-class codes of behavior, with each gender in its proper place, and only
if it speaks a language of productivity, patriotism, and self-policing
victimhood.

And yet the vast majority of us are not “safe” simply going through our daily
lives in Oakland, or elsewhere. When activists claim that poor black and brown
communities must not defend themselves against racist attacks or confront the
state, including using illegal or “violent” means, they typically advocate
instead the performance of an image of legitimate victimhood for white middle
class consumption. The activities of marginalized groups are barely recognized
unless they perform the role of peaceful and quaint ethnics who by nature
cannot confront power on their own. Contemporary anti-oppression politics
constantly reproduces stereotypes about the passivity and powerlessness of
these populations, when in fact it is precisely people from these groups –
poor women of color defending their right to land and housing, trans\* street
workers fighting back against murder and violence, black, brown, and Asian
American militant struggles against white supremacist attacks – who have waged
the most powerful and successfully militant uprisings in American history. We
refuse a politics which infantilizes us and people who look like us, and which
continually paints nonwhite and/or nonmale demographics as helpless,
vulnerable, and incapable of fighting for our own liberation.

When activists argue that power “belongs in the hands of the most oppressed,”
it is clear that their primary audience for these appeals can only be liberal
white activists, and that they understand power as something which is granted
or bestowed by the powerful. Appeals to white benevolence to let people of
color “lead political struggles” assumes that white activists can somehow
relinquish their privilege and legitimacy to oppressed communities and that
these communities cannot act and take power for themselves.

People of color, women, and queers are constantly compared to children in
contemporary privilege discourse. Even children can have a more savvy and
sophisticated analysis than privilege theorists often assume! “Communities of
color” have become in contemporary liberal anti-oppression discourse akin to
endangered species in need of management by sympathetic whites or “community
representatives” assigned to contain political conflict at all costs.

And of course it is extremely advantageous to the powers that be for the
oppressed to be infantilized and deterred from potentially “unsafe”
self-defense, resistance, or attack. The absence of active mass resistance to
racist policies and institutions in Oakland and in the US over the last forty
years has meant that life conditions have worsened for nearly everyone. The
prisons, police, state, economy, and borders perpetually reproduce racial
inequality by categorizing, profiling, and enforcing demographic identities
and assigning them to positions in a hierarchy of domination where
marginalized groups can only gain power through the exploitation and
oppression of others. The budget cuts and healthcare rollbacks are leaving
poor queer and trans people without access to necessary medical resources like
Aids medication or hormones, and other austerity measures have dovetailed with
increasingly misogynist anti-reproductive-rights legislature which will surely
result in an increasing and invisible number of deaths among women. As
“diversity” has increased in city and state governments, and in some sectors
of the corporate world, deepening economic stratification has rendered this
form of representational “equality” almost entirely symbolic.

We have been told that because the “Occupy” movement protests something called
“economic inequality” it is not a movement about or for people of color,
despite the fact that subprime targeting of Blacks and Latinos within the
housing market has led to losses between $164 billion and $213 billion, one of
the greatest transfers of wealth out of these populations in recent history.
And despite the fact that job losses are affecting women of color more than
any other group.

We are told that because the “economy” has always targeted poor people of
color, that increasing resistance from a multiracial cohort of young people
and students, and from downwardly mobile members of the white working and
middle class, has nothing to do with people of color – but that somehow
reclaiming and recreating an idealized cultural heritage does. We are told
that we are “tokens” or “informants” if we remain critical of a return to
essentialist traditional cultural identities which are beyond political
discussion, and of the conservative political project of rebuilding “the many
systems of civilization—economics, government, politics, spirituality,
environmental sustainability, nutrition, medicine and understandings of self,
identity, gender and sexuality—that existed before colonization.”

We reject race and gender blind economic struggles and analysis, but we do not
reject struggles against what is, under capitalism, naturalized as the
“economy.” While the majority of Occupy general assemblies have adopted a
neo-populist rhetoric of economic improvement or reform, we see the abolition
of the system of capital as not peripheral but fundamental to any material
project of ending oppression.

Recent statistics give a snapshot of worsening racial inequality in the US
today: the median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black
households and 18 times that of Hispanic households, the greatest wealth
disparities in 25 years. Over 1 in 4 Native Americans and Native Alaskans live
in poverty, with a nearly 40% poverty rate for reservations. From 2005 to
2009, Latin@s’ household median wealth fell by 66%, black household wealth by
53%, but only 16% among white households. The average black household in 2009
possessed $5,677 in wealth; Latin@ households $6,325; and the average white
household had $113,149.

To address these deteriorating material conditions and imagine solutions in
terms of privilege is to tacitly support the continual state and economic
reproduction of racial and gender hierarchies, and renew racist and
patriarchal violence in the 21st century.

### c. On Nonprofit Certified “White Allies” and Privilege Theory

Communities of color are not a single, homogenous bloc with identical
political opinions. There is no single unified antiracist, feminist, and queer
political program which white liberals can somehow become “allies” of, despite
the fact that some individuals or groups of color may claim that they are in
possession of such a program. This particular brand of white allyship both
flattens political differences between whites and homogenizes the populations
they claim to speak on behalf of. We believe that this politics remains
fundamentally conservative, silencing, and coercive, especially for people of
color who reject the analysis and field of action offered by privilege theory.

In one particularly stark example of this problem from a December 4 2011
Occupy Oakland general assembly, “white allies” from a local social justice
nonprofit called “The Catalyst Project” arrived with an array of other groups
and individuals to Oscar Grant/Frank Ogawa Plaza, order to speak in favor of a
proposal to rename Occupy Oakland to “Decolonize/Liberate Oakland.” Addressing
the audience as though it were homogeneously white, each white “ally” who
addressed the general assembly explained that renouncing their own white
privilege meant supporting the renaming proposal. And yet in the public
responses to the proposal it became clear that a substantial number of people
of color in the audience, including the founding members of one of Occupy
Oakland’s most active and effective autonomous groups, which is also majority
people of color, the “Tactical Action Committee,” deeply opposed the measure.

What was at stake was a political disagreement, one that was not clearly
divided along racial lines. However, the failure of the renaming proposal was
subsequently widely misrepresented as a conflict between “white Occupy” and
the “Decolonize/Liberate Oakland” group. In our experience such
misrepresentations are not accidental or isolated incidents but a repeated
feature of a dominant strain of Bay Area anti-oppression politics which –
instead of mobilizing people of color, women, and queers for independent
action – has consistently erased the presence of people of color in
interracial coalitions.

White supremacy and racist institutions will not be eliminated through
sympathetic white activists spending several thousand dollars for nonprofit
diversity trainings which can assist them in recognizing their own racial
privilege and certifying their decision to do so. The absurdity of privilege
politics recenters antiracist practice on whites and white behavior, and
assumes that racism (and often by implicit or explicit association, sexism,
homophobia, and transphobia) manifest primarily as individual privileges which
can be “checked,” given up, or absolved through individual resolutions.
Privilege politics is ultimately completely dependent upon precisely that
which it condemns: *white benevolence*.

## IV. Occupy Oakland as Example

### a. Occupy Oakland, “Outside Agitators,” and “White Occupy”

When Mayor Quan and District Attorney Nancy O’Malley claim that Occupy Oakland
is not part of the national Occupy movement, they’re onto something. From the
start, Occupy Oakland immediately rejected cooperation with city government
officials, wildly flexible state and media definitions of “violence,” and a
now largely discredited arguments that the police are part of “the 99%.” After
the coordinated raids on Occupy encampments across the country, the
innumerable incidents of police violence, and slowly emerging details about
the involvement of the Department of Homeland Security and its information
“fusion” centers, the supporters of collaboration with the police have fallen
silent.

The press releases of the city government, Oakland Police Department, and
business associations like the Oakland Chamber of Commerce continually repeat
that the Occupy Oakland encampment, feeding nearly a thousand mostly
desperately poor people a day, was composed primarily of non-Oakland resident
“white outsiders” intent on destroying the city. For anyone who spent any
length of time at the encampment, Occupy Oakland was clearly one of the most
racially and ethnically diverse Occupy encampments in the country—composed of
people of color from all walks of life, from local business owners to fired
Oakland school teachers, from college students to the homeless and seriously
mentally ill. Unfortunately, social justice activists, clergy, and community
groups mimicked the city’s erasure of people of color in their analysis of
Occupy, when they were not negotiating with the mayor’s office behind closed
doors to dismantle the encampment “peacefully.”

From the beginning the Occupy Oakland encampment existed in a tightening vise
between two faces of the state: nonprofits and the police. An array of
community organizations immediately began negotiating with city bureaucracies
and pushing for the encampment to adopt nonviolence pledges and move to Snow
Park (itself later cleared by OPD despite total compliance of individuals who
settled there). At the same time, police departments across the Bay Area
readying one of the largest and most expensive paramilitary operations in
recent history. It became increasingly clear that the city’s reputation for
progressive activism could not tolerate the massing of Oakland’s homeless, and
the extent of urban social damage, made visible in one location.

![Oakland city fficials and local business people stage an Occupy Oakland counterdemonstration on the steps of City Hall.](images/oakland/8.jpg)

The ongoing history of Occupy Oakland is a case study in how much antiracist
politics has changed since Bobby Seale and Elaine Brown attempted to run for
Oakland mayor and city council respectively in 1973 against a sea of white
incumbents. Oakland’s current city government—including the mayor’s office,
city council, and Oakland Police Department—is now staffed and led
predominantly by people of color. State-sanctioned representatives who claim
to speak for Oakland’s “people of color,” “women,” or “queers” *as a whole*
are part of a system of patronage and power which ensures that anyone who gets
a foot up does so on the backs of a hundred others.

Whatever the rhetoric of these politicians, their job is to make sure the
downtown property owners and homeowners in the hills are insulated from
potential crime and rebellion from the flatlands due to increasingly severe
budget cuts to social services, police impunity, and mass incarceration.
Increasing numbers of Oaklanders rely upon a massive, unacknowledged
informal/illegal economy of goods, services, and crime in order to survive. In
other words their job is to contain this economy, largely through spending
half (or over $200 million annually, and $58 million in lawsuit settlements
over the past 10 years) of the city budget on the police department. When city
politicians argue that protests are the work of “outsiders,” they’re also
asserting the city government and the Oakland Police Department truly
represent the city.

We do not believe that a politics rooted in privilege theory and calling for
more racial diversity in fundamentally racist and patriarchal institutions
like the Oakland Police Department, can challenge Oakland’s existing
hierarchies of power. This form of representational anti-oppression activism
is no longer even remotely anticapitalist in its analysis and aims.

By borrowing a charge used against civil rights movement participants and
60s-era militants of color like Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, and even
Martin Luther King Jr., as “outside agitators,” city residents have been told
that the interests of all “authentic Oaklanders” are the same. The one month
Occupy Oakland encampment was blamed by the Oakland Chamber of Commerce and
its city government partners for everything from deepening city poverty to the
failure of business led development, from the rats which have always infested
the city plaza to the mounting cost of police brutality. An encampment which
fed about a thousand people every day of its month-long existence, and which
witnessed a 19% decrease in area crime in the last week of October, was
scapegoated for the very poverty, corruption, and police violence it came into
existence to engage.

![Real estate mogul and city power broker Phil Tagami patrolling the Rotunda
Building with a shotgun on the day of the November 2nd Oakland general
strike.](images/oakland/9.jpg)

If you believe the city press releases, “authentic Oaklanders” are truly
represented by a police force which murders and imprisons its poor black and
brown residents daily (about 7% of OPD officers actually live in the city) and
a city government which funnels their taxes into business-friendly
redevelopment deals like the $91 million dollar renovation of the Fox
Theater—$58 million over budget—which line the pockets of well-connected real
estate developers like Phil Tagami. In a complete reversal of 60s-era militant
antiracist political movements, we are told by these politicians and pundits
that militant, disruptive, and confrontational political actions which target
this city bureaucracy and its police forces can only be the work of white,
middle class, and otherwise privileged youths.

### b. The Erasure of People of Color From Occupy Oakland

![Some of Occupy Oakland’s “White Anarchist Outside
Agitators”](images/oakland/10.jpg)

A recent communique critiquing the Occupy movement states, “The participation
of people of color [in Occupy Oakland] does not change the fact that this
occupation of public space upholds white supremacy…. Some of our own sisters
and brothers have silenced our critiques in order to hold on to their
positions of power as token people of color in the movement.”[^5] The
communique argues that people of color can suddenly “uphold” white supremacy
because they do not share the political analysis of the document’s authors.
People of color who do not agree with the politics advanced by this group are
labeled white, informants, members of Cointelpro, or tokens. Often many of us
are simply erased. This is a powerful and deeply manipulative rhetorical
tactic which simply fails to engage substantively with any of the reasons why
people of color did participate in Occupy Oakland and equates critical
participation with support for rape, racism, sexism, homophobia, and
gentrification. Needless to say, the authors of the above-quoted passage do
not speak for us.

People of color who were not only active but central to Occupy Oakland and its
various committees are routinely erased from municipal and activist accounts
of the encampment. In subsequent months the camp has been denounced by social
justice activists, many of whom work directly with the mayor’s office, who
have criticized it as a space irreparably compromised by racial and gender
privilege. Racism, patriarchy, homophobia, and transphobia were all clearly on
display at Occupy Oakland – as they are in every sector of social life in
Oakland. None of these accounts has even begun to examine how the perpetrators
and victims of this violence did not belong to a single racial demographic, or
track the evolving efforts of participants to respond to this violence.

People of color, women and trans\* people of color, and white women and
trans\* people who participated heavily in Occupy Oakland have regularly
become both white and (cis) male if they hold to a politics which favors
confrontation over consciousness raising. And within white communities,
similar political disagreements are routinely represented as differences
between individuals with “white privilege” and those who are “white allies.”

There is clearly a need to reflect upon how the dynamics of the encampments
quickly overwhelmed the capacity of participants to provide services and
spaces free from sexual harassment and violence. To describe the participants
of Occupy Oakland as primarily white men is not simply politically problematic
and factually incorrect – it also prevents us from being able to look honestly
at the social interactions that have actually occurred under its auspices.

## V. Conclusion: Recuperating Decolonization and National Liberation Struggles; or, Revolution is Radically Unsafe

![Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor whose suicide helped spark the
“Arab Spring.”](images/oakland/11.jpg)

Nearly fifty years after the dramatic upsurge of wars of national liberation
fought over the terrain of what used to be called the “Third World,” there are
few political tools for confronting emerging local and global racisms between
nonwhite communities, and the persecution of ethnic minorities in former
colonies by native, nonwhite elites. In the US, this has taken the form of
increasing antiblack, Islamophobic, and anti-immigrant racism within
“communities of color” and increasing class divisions within nonwhite
demographic categories.

National elites in decolonizing countries have frequently appealed to
idealized ethnic traditions and histories in order to cement social cohesion
and hierarchies of domination within dictatorial one-party states. Appeals to
a kind of authoritarian traditionalism often mobilize components of indigenous
traditions which justify caste or caste-like social divisions. No longer
requiring the force of occupying armies, formal decolonization in newly
“independent” countries from Senegal to Vietnam has given way to neocolonial
austerity, structural adjustment, and debt imposed by the global north and
administered by those who Frantz Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, famously
called the native “national bourgeoisie.”

As Maia Ramnath observes about the actually-existing history of formal
decolonization, “In seeking to replicate the techniques of colonial rule by
institutionalizing states rather than abolishing them, the nationalist goal
diverged from that of substantive decolonization. If the colonial regime’s
structures of oppression were not simply to be reopened for business under new
local management, yielding a new generation of authoritarian dictatorships and
cultural chauvinists, a different logic of anticolonial struggle was
imperative.

> …[T]he specter of stateness–the pressure to establish your own, or to resist
> the aggression of someone else’s…calls forth the enforcement of internal
> conformity, elimination of elements who fail or refuse to conform, and
> relentless policing of boundaries, including those of hereditary membership,
> for which task the control of female bodies, sexuality, and reproduction is
> essential.”

The belief that communities of color in the US to represent coherent, bounded
internal colonies or “nations” working for self-determination has been
stretched to the breaking point by class divisions within these communities.
To be clear: we believe that wealth can only buy limited protection against
worsening racism, sexism, and homophobia. We desire radical liberation, from
what theorists have called the “coloniality of power” and the institutions –
the borders, the nation-form, the churches, the prisons, the police, and the
military – which continue to materially reproduce racial, gender, class, and
sexual hierarchies on a global scale. And yet we believe that the political
content of contemporary decolonial struggles cannot be assumed in advance.

21st century decolonization in the US would be unrecognizable to the
individuals who have fought for liberation under the banner of anticolonial
struggle in the past—a tradition which includes Toussaint L’Ouverture, Jean
Jacques Dessalines, Lucy Parsons, Amilcar Cabral, Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X,
Angela Davis, Robert F. Williams, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin, the Third World
Women’s Alliance, CONAIE, the indigenous militants of Bolivia in 1990, the
militants of Oaxaca in 2006, the Mohawk people in the Municipality of Oka,
Tupac Katari, Chris Hani, Nelson Mandela (who led the ANC’s armed wing,
Umkhonto we Sizwe), Emiliano Zapata, Juan “Cheno” Cortina, Jose Rizal, Bhagat
Singh, Yuri Kochiyama, Kuwasi Balagoon, DRUM, Assata Shakur, and countless
others.

Anticolonial struggles were violent, disruptive, and radically unsafe for
individuals who fought and died for self-determination. One cannot be a
pacifist and believe in decolonization. One cannot be horrified at the burning
of an American flag and claim to support decolonization. And one cannot
guarantee the safety of anyone who is committed to the substantive
decolonization of white supremacist institutions. The fact that decolonial
struggle has been reduced to state-sanctioned rituals of cultural affirmation,
and appeals to white radicals to stop putting the “vulnerable” in harm’s way,
reveals the extent to which contemporary privilege politics has appropriated
the radical movements of the past and remade them in its own image.

We are told that the victims of oppression must lead political struggles
against material structures of domination by those who oppose every means by
which the “victims” could actually overthrow these structures. We are told
that resistance lies in “speaking truth to power” rather than attacking power
materially. We are told by an array of highly trained “white allies” that the
very things we need to do in order to free ourselves from domination cannot be
done by us because we’re simply too vulnerable to state repression. At mass
rallies, we’re replayed endless empty calls for revolution and militancy from
a bygone era while in practice being forced to fetishize our spiritual
powerlessness.

We are told that the victims of oppression must lead political struggles
against material structures of domination by those who oppose every means by
which the “victims” could actually overthrow these structures. We are told
that resistance lies in “speaking truth to power” rather than attacking power
materially. We are told that it is “privileged” to attempt to practically
interfere with budget cuts, foreclosures, teacher firings, disappearing
schools, hunger, or the loss of healthcare. We are told by an array of highly
trained “white allies” that the very things we need to do in order to free
ourselves from domination cannot be done by marginalized communities because
they’re simply too vulnerable to state repression. At mass rallies, we’re
replayed endless empty calls for revolution and militancy from a bygone era
while in practice being forced to fetishize our spiritual powerlessness.

In a country where the last eruption of widespread political unrest was nearly
forty years when the police go to war and it is called “force.” When business
as usual is disrupted in any way, even by shouting, it is labeled “violent.”
In this upside down world militant protests across the globe are characterized
as heroic struggles for freedom while in the US SWAT teams are deployed to
clear reproductive rights rallies. As an October 24th, 2011 letter from
“Comrades in Cairo” published in The Guardian puts it, “In our ownoccupations
of Tahrir, we encountered people entering the square every day in tears
because it was the first time they had walked through those streets and spaces
without being harassed by police; it is not just the ideas that are important,
these spaces are fundamental to the possibility of a new world. These are
public spaces. Spaces for gathering, leisure, meeting and interacting – these
spaces should be the reason we live in cities. Where the state and the
interests of owners have made them inaccessible, exclusive or dangerous, it is
up to us to make sure that they are safe, inclusive and just. We have and must
continue to open them to anyone that wants to build a better world,
particularly for the marginalised, the excluded and those groups who have
suffered the worst.

[...]

Those who said that the Egyptian revolution was peaceful did not see the
horrors that police visited upon us, nor did they see the resistance and even
force that revolutionaries used against the police to defend their tentative
occupations and spaces: by the government’s own admission, 99 police stations
were put to the torch, thousands of police cars were destroyed and all of the
ruling party’s offices around Egypt were burned down. Barricades were erected,
officers were beaten back and pelted with rocks even as they fired tear gas
and live ammunition on us. But at the end of the day on 28 January they
retreated, and we had won our cities.

It is not our desire to participate in violence, but it is even less our
desire to lose. If we do not resist, actively, when they come to take what we
have won back, then we will surely lose. Do not confuse the tactics that we
used when we shouted ‘peaceful’ with fetishising nonviolence; if the state had
given up immediately we would have been overjoyed, but as they sought to abuse
us, beat us, kill us, we knew that there was no other option than to fight
back. Had we laid down and allowed ourselves to be arrested, tortured and
martyred to ‘make a point,’ we would be no less bloodied, beaten and dead. Be
prepared to defend these things you have occupied, that you are building,
because, after everything else has been taken from us, these reclaimed spaces
are so very precious.”[^6]
