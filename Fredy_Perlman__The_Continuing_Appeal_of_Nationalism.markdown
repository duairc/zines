Nationalism was proclaimed dead several times during the present century:

-   the first world war, when the last empires of Europe, the Austrian and the
    Turkish, were broken up into self-determined nations, and no deprived
    nationalists remained, except the Zionists;

-   after the Bolshevik coup d’etat, when it was said that the bourgeoisie’s
    struggles for self-determination were henceforth superseded by struggles
    of workingmen, who had no country;

-   after the military defeat of Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany,
    when the genocidal corollaries of nationalism had been exhibited for all
    to see, when it was thought that nationalism as creed and as practice was
    permanently discredited.

Yet forty years after the military defeat of Fascists and National Socialists,
we can see that nationalism did not only survive but was born again, underwent
a revival. Nationalism has been revived not only by the so-called right, but
also and primarily by the so-called left. After the national socialist war,
nationalism ceased to be confined to conservatives, became the creed and
practice of revolutionaries, and proved itself to be the only revolutionary
creed that actually worked.

Leftist or revolutionary nationalists insist that their nationalism has
nothing in common with the nationalism of fascists and national socialists,
that theirs is a nationalism of the oppressed, that it offers personal as well
as cultural liberation. The claims of the revolutionary nationalists have been
broadcast to the world by the two oldest continuing hierarchic institutions
surviving into our times: the Chinese State and, more recently, the Catholic
Church. Currently nationalism is being touted as a strategy, science and
theology of liberation, as a fulfillment of the Enlightenment’s dictum that
knowledge is power, as a proven answer to the question “What Is to be Done?”.

To challenge these claims, and to see them in a context, I have to ask what
nationalism is — not only the new revolutionary nationalism but also the old
conservative one. I cannot start by defining the term, because nationalism is
not a word with a static definition: it is a term that covers a sequence of
different historical experiences. I’ll start by giving a brief sketch of some
of those experiences.

* * *

According to a common (and manipulable) misconception, imperialism is
relatively recent, consists of the colonization of the entire world, and is
the last stage of capitalism. This diagnosis points to a specific cure:
nationalism is offered as the antidote to imperialism: wars of national
liberation are said to break up the capitalist empire.

This diagnosis serves a purpose, but it does not describe any event or
situation. We come closer to the truth when we stand this conception on its
head and say that imperialism was the first stage of capitalism, that the
world was subsequently colonized by nation-states, and that nationalism is the
dominant, the current, and (hopefully) the last stage of capitalism. The facts
of the case were not discovered yesterday; they are as familiar as the
misconception that denies them.

It has been convenient, for various good reasons, to forget that, until recent
centuries, the dominant powers of Eurasia were not nation-states but empires.
A Celestial Empire ruled by the Ming dynasty an Islamic Empire ruled by the
Ottoman dynasty and a Catholic Empire ruled by the Hapsburg dynasty vied with
each other for possession of the known world. Of the three, the Catholics were
not the first imperialists but the last. The Celestial Empire of the Mings
ruled over most of eastern Asia and had dispatched vast commercial fleets
overseas a century before sea-borne Catholics invaded Mexico.

The celebrants of the Catholic feat forget that, between 1420 and 1430,
Chinese imperial bureaucrat Cheng Ho commanded naval expeditions of 70,000 men
and sailed, not only to nearby Malaya, Indonesia and Ceylon, but as far from
home ports as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and Africa. The celebrants of
Catholic conquistadores also belittle the imperial feats of the Ottomans, who
conquered all but the westernmost provinces of the former Roman Empire, ruled
over North Africa, Arabia, the Middle East and half of Europe, controlled the
Mediterranean and hammered on the gates of Vienna. The imperial Catholics set
out westward, beyond the boundaries of the known world, in order to escape
from encirclement.

Nevertheless, it was the imperial Catholics who “discovered America,” and
their genocidal destruction and plunder of their ‘discovery’ changed the
balance of forces among Eurasia’s empires.

Would imperial Chinese or Turks have been less lethal had they “discovered
America”? All three empires regarded aliens as less than human and therefore
as legitimate prey. The Chinese considered others barbarians; the Muslims and
Catholics considered others unbelievers. The term unbeliever is not as brutal
as the term barbarian, since an unbeliever ceases to be legitimate prey until
she or he is made over by the civilizer.

The term unbeliever, and the morality behind it, conflicted with the practice
of the Catholic invaders. The contradiction between professions and acts was
spotted by a very early critic, a priest called Las Casas, who noted that the
conversion ceremonies were pretexts for separating and exterminating the
unconverted, and that the converts themselves were not treated as fellow
Catholics but as slaves.

The critiques of Las Casas did little more than embarrass the Catholic Church
and Emperor. Laws were passed and investigators were dispatched, but to little
effect, because the two aims of the Catholic expeditions, conversion and
plunder, were contradictory. Most churchmen reconciled themselves to saving
the gold and damning the souls. The Catholic Emperor increasingly depended on
the plundered wealth to pay for the imperial household, army, and for the
fleets that carried the plunder.

Plunder continued to take precedence over conversion, but the Catholics
continued to be embarrassed. Their ideology was not altogether suited to their
practice. The Catholics made much of their conquests of Aztecs and Incas, whom
they described as empires with institutions similar to those of the Hapsburg
Empire and the religious practices as demonic as those of the official enemy,
the heathen empire of the Ottoman Turks. But the Catholics did not make much
of the wars of extermination against communities that had neither emperors nor
standing armies. Such feats, although perpetrated regularly, conflicted with
the ideology and were less than heroic.

The contradiction between the invaders’ professions and their acts was not
resolved by the imperial Catholics. It was resolved by harbingers of a new
social form, the nation-state. Two harbingers appeared during the same year,
1561, when one of the Emperor’s overseas adventures proclaimed his
independence from the empire, and several of the Emperor’s bankers and
provisioners launched a war of independence.

The overseas adventurer, Lope de Aguirre, failed to mobilize support and was
executed.

The Emperor’s bankers and provisioners mobilized the inhabitants of several
imperial provinces and succeeded in severing the provinces from the empire
(provinces which were later called Holland).

These two events were not yet struggles of national liberation. They were
harbingers of things to come. They were also reminders of things past. In the
bygone Roman Empire, Praetorian guards had been engaged to protect the
Emperor; the guards had assumed ever more of the Emperor’s functions and had
eventually wielded the imperial power instead of the Emperor. In the Arabic
Islamic Empire, the Caliph had engaged Turkish bodyguards to protect his
person; the Turkish guards, like the earlier Praetorians, had assumed ever
more of the Caliph’s functions and had eventually taken over the imperial
palace as well as the imperial office.

Lope de Aguirre and the Dutch grandees were not the Hapsburg monarch’s
bodyguards, but the Andean colonial adventurer and the Dutch commercial and
financial houses did wield important imperial functions. These rebels, like
the earlier Roman and Turkish guards, wanted to free themselves of the
spiritual indignity and material burden of serving the Emperor; they already
wielded the Emperor’s powers; the Emperor was nothing more to them than a
parasite.

Colonial adventurer Aguirre was apparently inept as a rebel; his time had not
yet come.

The Dutch grandees were not inept, and their time had come. They did not
overthrow the empire; they rationalized it. The Dutch commercial and financial
houses already possessed much of the New World’s wealth; they had received it
as payment for provisioning the Emperor’s fleets, armies and household. They
now set out to plunder colonies in their own name and for their own benefit,
unshackled by a parasitic overlord. And since they were not Catholics but
Calvinist Protestants, they were not embarrassed by any contradiction between
professions and acts. They made no profession of saving souls. Their Calvinism
told them that an inscrutable God had saved or damned all souls at the
beginning of Time and no Dutch priest could alter God’s plan.

The Dutch were not crusaders; they confined themselves to unheroic, humorless,
and businesslike plunder, calculated and regularized; the plundering fleets
departed and returned on schedule. The fact that the plundered aliens were
unbelievers became less important than the fact that they were not Dutchmen.

West Eurasian forerunners of nationalism coined the term savages. This term
was a synonym for the east Eurasian Celestial Empire’s term barbarians. Both
terms designated human beings as legitimate prey.

* * *

During the following two centuries, the invasions, subjugations and
expropriations initiated by the Hapsburgs were imitated by other European
royal houses.

Seen through the lenses of nationalist historians, the initial colonizers as
well as their later imitators look like nations: Spain, Holland, England,
France. But seen from a vantage point in the past, the colonizing powers are
Hapsburgs, Tudors, Stuarts, Bourbons, Oranges — namely dynasties identical to
the dynastic families that had been feuding for wealth and power ever since
the fall of the western Roman empire. The invaders can be seen from both
vantage points because a transition was taking place. The entities were no
longer mere feudal estates, but they were not yet full-fledged nations; they
already possessed some, but not yet all, the attributes of a nation-state. The
most notable missing element was the national army. Tudors and Bourbons
already manipulated the Englishness or Frenchness of their subjects,
especially during wars against another monarch’s subjects. But neither Scots
and Irishmen, not Corsicans and Provencals, were recruited to fight and die
for “the love of their country.” War was an onerous feudal burden, a corvée;
the only patriots were patriots of Eldorado.

The tenets of what was going to become the nationalist creed did not appeal to
the ruling dynasts, who clung to their own tried and tested tenets. The new
tenets appealed to the dynast’s higher servants, his money-lenders,
spice-vendors, military suppliers and colony-plunderers. These people, like
Lope de Aguirre and the Dutch grandees, like earlier Roman and Turkish guards,
wielded key functions yet remained servants. Many if not most of them burned
to shake off the indignity and the burden, to rid themselves of the parasitic
overlord, to carry on the exploitation of countrymen and the plunder of
colonials in their own name and for their own benefit.

Later known as the bourgeoisie or the middle class, these people had become
rich and powerful since the days of the first westward-bound fleets. A portion
of their wealth had come from the plundered colonies, as payment for the
services they had sold to the Emperor; this sum of wealth would later be
called a primitive accumulation of capital. Another portion of their wealth
had come from the plunder of their own local countrymen and neighbors by a
method later known as capitalism; the method was not altogether new, but it
became very widespread after the middle classes got their hands on the New
World’s silver and gold.

These middle classes wielded important powers, but they were not yet
experienced in wielding the central political power. In England they overthrew
a monarch and proclaimed a commonwealth but, fearing that the popular energies
they had mobilized against the upper class could turn against the middle
class, they soon restored another monarch of the same dynastic house.

Nationalism did not really come into its own until the late 1700s when two
explosions, thirteen years apart, reversed the relative standing of the two
upper classes and permanently changed the political geography of the globe. In
1776, colonial merchants and adventurers reenacted Aguirre’s feat of
proclaiming their independence from the ruling overseas dynast, outdid their
predecessor by mobilizing their fellow-settlers, and succeeded in severing
themselves from the Hanoverian British Empire. And in 1789, enlightened
merchants and scribes outdid their Dutch forerunners by mobilizing, not a few
outlying provinces, but the entire subject population, by overthrowing and
slaying the ruling Bourbon monarch, and by remaking all feudal bonds into
national bonds. These two events marked the end of an era. Henceforth even the
surviving dynasts hastily or gradually became nationalists, and the remaining
royal estates took on ever more of the attributes of nation-states.

* * *

The two eighteenth century revolutions were very different, and they
contributed different and even conflicting elements to the creed and practice
of nationalism. I do not intend to analyze these events here, but only to
remind the reader of some of the elements.

Both rebellions successfully broke the bonds of fealty to a monarchic house,
and both ended with the establishment of capitalist nation-states, but between
the first act and the last they had little in common. The main animators of
both revolts were familiar with the rationalistic doctrines of the
Enlightenment, but the self-styled Americans confined themselves to political
problems, largely to the problem of establishing a state machinery that could
take up where King George left off. Many of the French went much further; they
posed the problem of restructuring not only the state but all of society; they
challenged not only the bond of subject to monarch, but also the bond of slave
to master, a bond that remained sacred to the Americans. Both groups were
undoubtedly familiar with Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s observation that human
beings were born free, yet everywhere were bound in chains, but the French
understood the chains more profoundly and made a greater effort to break them.

As influenced by rationalistic doctrines as Rousseau himself had been, French
revolutionaries tried to apply social reason to the human environment in the
same way that natural reason, or science, was starting to be applied to the
natural environment. Rousseau had worked at his desk; he had tried to
establish social justice of paper, by entrusting human affairs to an entity
that embodied the general will. The revolutionaries agitated to establish
social justice not only on paper, but in the midst of mobilized and armed
human beings, many of them enraged, most of them poor.

Rousseau’s abstract entity took the concrete form of a Committee of Public
Safety (or Public Health), a police organization that considered itself the
embodiment of the general will. The virtuous committee members conscientiously
applied the findings of reason to human affairs. They considered themselves
the nation’s surgeons. They carved their personal obsessions into society by
means of the state’s razor blade.

The application of science to the environment took the form of systematic
terror. The instrument of Reason and Justice was the guillotine.

The Terror decapitated the former rulers and then turned on the
revolutionaries.

Fear stimulated a reaction that swept away the Terror as well as the Justice.
The mobilized energy of bloodthirsty patriots was sent abroad, to impose
enlightenment on foreigners by force, to expand the nation into an empire. The
provisioning of national armies was far more lucrative than the provisioning
of feudal armies ever had been, and former revolutionaries became rich and
powerful members of the middle class, which was now the top class, the ruling
class. The terror as well as the wars bequeathed a fateful legacy to the creed
and practice of later nationalisms.

The legacy of the American revolution was of an altogether different kind. The
Americans were less concerned with justice, more concerned with property.

The settler-invaders on the northern continent’s eastern shore needed George
of Hanover no more urgently then Lope de Aguirre had needed Philip of
Hapsburg. Or rather, the rich and powerful among the settlers needed King
George’s apparatus to protect their wealth, but not to gin it. If they could
organize a repressive apparatus on their own, they would not need King George
at all.

Confident of their ability to launch an apparatus of their own, the colonial
slave-holders, land-speculators, produce-exporters and bankers found the
King’s taxes and acts intolerable. The most intolerable of the King’s acts was
the act that temporarily banned unauthorized incursions into the lands of the
continent’s original inhabitants; the King’s advisers had their eyes on the
animal furs supplied by indigenous hunters; the revolutionary land-speculators
had theirs on the hunters’ lands.

Unlike Aguirre, the federated colonizers of the north succeeded in
establishing their own independent repressive apparatus, and they did this by
stirring up a minimum of cravings for justice; their aim was to overthrow the
King’s power, not their own. Rather than rely excessively on their less
fortunate fellow-settlers or backwoods squatters, not to speak of their
slaves, these revolutionaries relied on mercenaries and on indispensable aid
from the Bourbon monarch who would be overthrown a few years later by more
virtuous revolutionaries.

The North American colonizers broke the traditional bonds of fealty and feudal
obligation but, unlike the French, they only gradually replaced the
traditional bonds with bonds of patriotism and nationhood. They were not quite
a nation; their reluctant mobilization of the colonial countryside had not
fused them into one, and the multi-lingual, multi-cultural and socially
divided underlying population resisted such a fusion. The new repressive
apparatus was not tried and tested, and it did not command the undivided
loyalty of the underlying population, which was not yet patriotic. Something
else was needed. Slave-masters who had overthrown their king feared that their
slaves could similarly overthrow the masters; the insurrection in Haiti made
this fear less than hypothetical. And although they no longer feared being
pushed into the sea by the continent’s indigenous inhabitants, the traders and
speculators worried about their ability to thrust further into the continent’s
interior.

The American settler-invaders had recourse to an instrument that was not, like
the guillotine, a new invention, but that was just as lethal. This instrument
would later be called Racism, and it would become embedded in nationalist
practice. Racism, like later products of practical Americans, was a pragmatic
principle; its content was not important; what mattered was the fact that it
worked.

Human beings were mobilized in terms of their lowest and most superficial
common denominator, and they responded. People who had abandoned their
villages and families, who were forgetting their languages and losing their
cultures, who were all but depleted of their sociability, were manipulated
into considering their skin color a substitute for all they had lost. They
were made proud of something that was neither a personal feat nor even, like
language, a personal acquisition. They were fused into a nation of white men.
(White women and children existed only as scalped victims, as proofs of the
bestiality of the hunted prey.) The extent of the depletion is revealed by the
nonentities the white men shared with each other: white blood, white thoughts,
and membership in a white race. Debtors, squatters and servants, as white men,
had everything in common with bankers, land speculators and plantation owners,
nothing in common with Redskins, Blackskins or Yellowskins. Fused by such a
principle, they could also be mobilized by it, turned into white mobs. Lynch
mobs, “Indian fighters.”

Racism had initially been one among several methods of mobilizing colonial
armies, and although it was exploited more fully in America than it ever had
been before, it did not supplant the other methods but rather supplemented
them. The victims of the invading pioneers were still described as
unbelievers, as heathen. But the pioneers, like the earlier Dutch, were
largely Protestant Christians, and they regarded heathenism as something to be
punished, not remedied. The victims also continued to be designated as
savages, cannibals and primitives, but these terms, too, ceased to be
diagnoses of conditions that could be remedied, and tended to become synonyms
of non-white, a condition that could not be remedied. Racism was an ideology
perfectly suited to a practice of enslavement and extermination.

The lynch-mob approach, the ganging-up on victims defined as inferior,
appealed to bullies whose humanity was stunted and who lacked any notion of
fair play. But this approach did not appeal to everyone. American businessmen,
part hustlers and part confidence men, always had something for everyone. For
the numerous Saint Georges with some notion of honor and great thirst for
heroism, the enemy was depicted somewhat differently; for them there were
nations as rich and powerful as their own in the trans-montane woodlands and
on the shores of the Great Lakes.

The celebrants of the heroic feats of imperial Spaniards had found empires in
central Mexico and on top of the Andes. The celebrants of nationalist American
heroes found nations; they transformed desperate resistances of an-archic
villagers into international conspiracies masterminded by military archons
such as General Pontiac and General Tecumseh; they peopled the woodlands with
formidable national leaders, efficient general staffs, and armies of
uncountable patriotic troops; they projected their own repressive structures
into the unknown; they saw an exact copy of themselves, with all the colors
reversed — something like a photographic negative. The enemy thus became an
equal in terms of structure, power and aims. War against such an enemy was not
only fair play; it was a dire necessity, a matter of life and death. The
enemy’s other attributes — the heathenism, the savagery, the cannibalism —
made the tasks of expropriating, enslaving and exterminating all the more
urgent, made these feats all the more heroic.

The repertory of the nationalist program was now more or less complete. This
statement might baffle a reader who cannot yet see any “real nations” in the
field. The United States was still a collection of multilingual,
multi-religious and multi-cultural ‘ethnicities’, and the French nation had
overflowed its boundaries and turned itself into a Napoleonic empire. The
reader might be trying to apply a definition of a nation as an organized
territory consisting of people who share a common language, religion and
customs, or at least one of the three. Such a definition, clear, pat and
static, is not a description of the phenomenon but an apology for it, a
justification. The phenomenon was not a static definition but a dynamic
process. The common language, religion and customs, like the white blood of
the American colonizers, were mere pretexts, instruments for mobilizing
armies. The culmination of the process was not an enshrinement of the
commonalities, but a depletion, a total loss of language, religion and
customs; the inhabitants of a nation spoke the language of capital, worshipped
on the altar of the state and confined their customs to those permitted by the
national police.

* * *

Nationalism is the opposite of imperialism only in the realm of definitions.
In practice, nationalism was a methodology for conduction the empire of
capital.

The continual increase of capital, often referred to as material progress,
economic development or industrialization, was the main activity of the middle
classes, the so-called bourgeoisie, because capital was what they owned, it
was their property; the upper classes owned estates.

The discovery of new worlds of wealth had enormously enriched these middle
classes, but had also made them vulnerable. The kings and nobles who initially
gathered the new world’s plundered wealth resented losing all but a few
trophies to their middle class merchants. This could not be helped. The wealth
did not arrive in usable forms; the merchants supplied the king with things he
could use, in exchange for the plundered treasures. Even so, monarchs who saw
themselves grow poor while their merchants grew rich were not above using
their armed retainers to plunder the wealthy merchants. Consequently the
middle classes suffered continual injuries under the old regime — injuries to
their property. The king’s army and police were not reliable protectors of
middle class property, and the powerful merchants, who already operated the
business of the empire, took measures to put an end to the instability; they
took the politics in hand as well. They could have hired private armies, and
they often did. But as soon as instruments for mobilizing national armies and
national police forces appeared on the horizon, the injured businessmen had
recourse to them. The main virtue of a national armed force is that it
guarantees that a patriotic servant will war alongside his own boss against an
enemy boss’s servant.

The stability assured by a national repressive apparatus gave the owners
something like a hothouse in which their capital could grow, increase,
multiply. The term ‘grow’ and its corollaries come from the capitalists’ own
vocabulary. These people think of a unit of capital as a grain or seed which
they invest in fertile soil. In spring they see a plant grow from each seed.
In summer they harvest so many seeds from each plant that, after paying for
the soil, sunshine and rain, they still have more seeds than they had
initially. The following year they enlarge their field, and gradually the
whole countryside becomes improved. In reality, the initial ‘grains’ are
money; the sunshine and rain are the expended energies of laborers; the plants
are factories, workshops and mines, the harvested fruits are commodities, bits
of processed world; and the excess or additional grains, the profits, are
emoluments which the capitalist keeps for himself instead of dividing them up
among the workers.

The process as a whole consisted of the processing of natural substances into
saleable items or commodities, and of the incarceration of wage workers in the
processing plants.

The marriage of Capital with Science was responsible for the great leap
forward into what we live in today. Pure scientists discovered the components
into which the natural environment could be decomposed; investors placed their
bets on the various methods of decomposition; applied scientists or managers
saw to it that the wage workers in their charge carried the project through.
Social scientists sought ways to make the workers less human, more efficient
and machine-like. Thanks to science, capitalists were able to transform much
of the natural environment into a processed world, an artifice, and to reduce
most human beings into efficient tenders of the artifice.

The process of capitalist production was analyzed and criticized by many
philosophers and poets, most notably by Karl Marx,[^1] whose critiques
animated, and continue to animate, militant social movements. Marx had a
significant blind spot; most of his disciples, and many militants who were not
his disciples, built their platforms on that blind spot. Marx was an
enthusiastic supporter of the bourgeoisie’s struggle for liberation from
feudal bonds — who was not an enthusiast in those days? He, who observed that
the ruling ideas of an epoch were the ideas of the ruling class, shared many
of the ideas of the newly empowered middle class. He was an enthusiast of the
Enlightenment, of rationalism, of material progress. It was Marx who
insightfully pointed out that every time a worker reproduced his labor power,
every minute he devoted to his assigned task, he enlarged the material and
social apparatus that dehumanized him. Yet the same Marx was an enthusiast for
the application of science to production.

Marx made a thorough analysis of the production process as an exploitation of
labor, but he made only cursory and reluctant comments about the prerequisite
for capitalist production, and the initial capital that made the process
possible.[^2] Without the initial capital, there could have been no
investments, no production, no great leap forward. This prerequisite was
analyzed by the early Soviet Russian marxist Preobrazhensky, who borrowed
several insights from the Polish marxist Rosa Luxemburg to formulate his
theory of primitive accumulation.[^3] By primitive, Preobrazhensky meant the
basement of the capitalist edifice, the foundation, the prerequisite. This
prerequisite cannot emerge from the capitalist production process itself, if
that process is not yet under way. It must, and does, come from outside the
production process. It comes from the plundered colonies. It comes from the
expropriated and exterminated populations of the colonies. In earlier days,
when there were no overseas colonies, the first capital, the prerequisite for
capitalist production, had been squeezed out of internal colonies, out of
plundered peasants whose lands were enclosed and crops requisitioned, out of
expelled Jews and Muslims whose possessions were expropriated.

The primitive or preliminary accumulation of capital is not something that
happened once, in the distant past, and never after. It is something that
continues to accompany the capitalist production process, and is an integral
part of it. The process described by Marx is responsible for the regular
profits are periodically destroyed by crises endemic to the system; new
injections of preliminary capital are the only known cure to the crises.
Without an ongoing primitive accumulation of capital, the production process
would stop; each crisis would tend to become permanent.

Genocide, the rationally calculated extermination of human populations
designated as legitimate prey, has not been an aberration in an otherwise
peaceful march of progress. Genocide has been a prerequisite of that progress.
This is why national armed forces were indispensable to the wielders of
capital. These forces did not only protect the owners of capital from the
insurrectionary wrath of their own exploited wage workers. These forces also
captured the holy grail, the magic lantern, the preliminary capital, by
battering the gates of resisting or unresisting outsiders, by looting,
deporting and murdering.

The footprints of the national armies are the traces of the march of progress.
These patriotic armies were, and still are, the seventh wonder of the world.
In them, the wolf lay alongside the lamb, the spider alongside the fly. In
them, exploited workers were the chums of exploiters, indebted peasants the
chums of creditors, suckers the chums of hustlers in a companionship
stimulated not by love but by hatred — hatred of potential sources of
preliminary capital designated as unbelievers, savages, inferior races.

Human communities as variegated in their ways and beliefs as birds are in
feathers were invaded, despoiled and at last exterminated beyond imagination’s
grasp. The clothes and artifacts of the vanished communities were gathered up
as trophies and displayed in museums as additional traces of the march of
progress; the extinct beliefs and ways became the curiosities of yet another
of the invaders’ many sciences. The expropriated fields, forests and animals
were garnered as bonanzas, as preliminary capital, as the precondition for the
production process that was to turn the fields into farms, the trees into
lumber, the animals into hats, the minerals into munitions, the human
survivors into cheap labor. Genocide was, and still is, the precondition, the
cornerstone and ground work of the military-industrial complexes, of the
processed environments, of the worlds of offices and parking lots.

Nationalism was so perfectly suited to its double task, the domestication of
workers and the despoliation of aliens, that it appealed to everyone —
everyone, that is, who wielded or aspired to wield a portion of capital.

During the nineteenth century, especially during its second half, every owner
of investable capital discovered that he had roots among the mobilizable
countryfolk who spoke his mother’s tongue and worshipped his father’s gods.
The fervor of such a nationalist was transparently cynical, since he was the
countryman who no longer had roots among his mother’s or father’s kin: he
found his salvation in his savings, prayed to his investments and spoke the
language of cost accounting. But he had learned, from Americans and Frenchmen,
that although he could not mobilize the countryfolk as loyal servants, clients
and customers, he could mobilize them as loyal fellow-Catholics, Orthodox or
Protestants. Languages, religions and customs became welding materials for the
construction of nation-states.

The welding materials were means, not ends. The purpose of the national
entities was not to develop languages, religions or customs, but to develop
national economies, to turn the countryfolk into workers and soldiers, to turn
the motherland into mines and factories, to turn dynastic estates into
capitalist enterprises. Without the capital, there could be no munitions or
supplies, no national army, no nation.

Savings and investments, market research and cost accounting, the obsessions
of the rationalistic former middle classes, became the ruling obsessions.
These rationalistic obsessions became not only sovereign but also exclusive.
Individuals who enacted other obsessions, irrational ones, were put away in
madhouses, asylums.

The nations usually were but need no longer have been monotheistic; the former
god or gods had lost their importance except as welding materials. The nations
were mono-obsessive, and if monotheism served the ruling obsession, then it
too was mobilized.

World War I marked the end of one phase of the nationalizing process, the
phase that had begun with the American and French revolutions, the phase that
had been announced much earlier by the declaration of Aguirre and the revolt
of the Dutch grandees. The conflicting claims of old and newly-constituted
nations were in fact the causes of that war. Germany, Italy and Japan, as well
as Greece, Serbia and colonial Latin America, had already taken on most of the
attributes of their nationalistic predecessors, had become national empires,
monarchies and republics, and the more powerful of the new arrivals aspired to
take on the main missing attribute, the colonial empire. During that war, all
the mobilizable components of the two remaining dynastic empires, the Ottoman
and the Hapsburg, constituted themselves into nations. When bourgeoisies with
different languages and religions, such as Turks and Armenians, claimed the
same territory, the weaker were treated like so-called American Indians; they
were exterminated. National Sovereignty and Genocide were — and still are —
corollaries.

Common language and religion appear to be corollaries of nationhood, but only
because of an optical illusion. As welding materials, languages and religions
were used when they served their purpose, discarded when they did not. Neither
multi-lingual Switzerland nor multi-religious Yugoslavia were banned from the
family of nations. The shapes of noses and the color of hair could also have
been used to mobilize patriots — and later were. The shared heritages, roots
and commonalities had to satisfy only one criterion, the criterion of
American-style pragmatic reason: did they work? Whatever worked was used. The
shared traits were important, not because of their cultural, historical or
philosophical content, but because they were useful for organizing a police to
protect the national property and for mobilizing an army to plunder the
colonies.

Once a nation was constituted, human beings who lived on the national
territory but did not possess the national traits could be transformed into
internal colonies, namely into sources of preliminary capital. Without
preliminary capital, no nation could become a great nation, and nations that
aspired to greatness but lacked adequate overseas colonies could resort to
plundering, exterminating and expropriating those of their countrymen who did
not possess the national traits.

* * *

The establishment of nation-states was greeted with euphoric enthusiasm by
poets as well as peasants who thought their muses or their gods had at last
descended to earth. The main wet blankets amidst the waving banners and flying
confetti were the former rulers, the colonized, and the disciples of Karl
Marx.

The overthrown and the colonized were unenthusiastic for obvious reasons.

The disciples of Marx were unenthusiastic because they had learned from the
master that national liberation meant national exploitation, that the national
government was the executive committee of the national capitalist class, that
the nation had nothing for workingmen, who were not themselves workingmen but
were as bourgeois as the ruling capitalists, proclaimed that the workingmen
had no country and organized themselves into an International. This
International split into three, and each International moved increasingly into
the field of Marx’s blind spot.

The First International was carried off by Marx’s one-time Russian translator
and then antagonist Bakunin, an inveterate rebel who had been a fervent
nationalist until he’d learned about exploitation from Marx. Bakunin and his
companions, rebels against all authorities, also rebelled against the
authority of Marx; Bakunin and his companions, rebels against all authorities,
also rebelled against the authority of Marx; they suspected Marx of trying to
turn the International into a state as repressive as the feudal and national
combined. Bakunin and his followers were unambiguous in their rejection of all
states, but they were ambiguous about capitalist enterprise. Even more than
Marx, they glorified science, celebrated material progress and hailed
industrialization. Being rebels, they considered every fight a good fight, but
the best of all was the fight against the bourgeoisie’s former enemies, the
fight against feudal landlords and the Catholic Church. Thus the Bakuninist
International flourished in places like Spain, where the bourgeoisie had not
completed its struggle for independence but had, instead, allied itself with
feudal barons and the Church for protection from insurgent workers and
peasants. The Bakuninists fought to complete the bourgeois revolution without
and against the bourgeoisie. They called themselves anarchists and disdained
all states, but did not begin to explain how they would procure the
preliminary or the subsequent industry, progress and science, namely the
capital, without an army and a police. They were never given a real chance to
resolve their contradiction in practice, and present day Bakuninists have
still not resolved it, have not even become aware that there is a
contradiction between anarchy and industry.

The Second International, less rebellious than the first, quickly came to
terms with capital as well as the state. Solidly entrenched in Marx’s blind
spot, the professors of this organization did not become enmeshed in any
Bakuninist contradiction. It was obvious to them that the exploitation and the
plunder were necessary conditions for the material progress, and they
realistically reconciled themselves to what could not be helped. All they
asked for was a greater share of the benefits for the workingmen, and offices
in the political establishment for themselves, as the workingmen’s
representatives. Like the good unionists who preceded and followed them, the
socialist professors were embarrassed by “the colonial question,” but their
embarrassment, like Philip Hapsburg’s, merely gave them bad consciences. In
time, imperial German socialists, royal Danish socialists and republican
French socialists even ceased to be internationalists.

The Third International did not only come to terms with capital and the state;
it made them its goal. This international was not formed by rebellious or
dissenting intellectuals; it was created by a state, the Russian state, after
the Bolshevik Party installed itself in that state’s offices. The main
activity of this international was to advertise the feats of the revamped
Russian state, of its ruling party, and of the party’s founder, a man who
called himself Lenin. The feats of that party and founder were indeed
momentous, but the advertisers did their best to hide what was most momentous
about them.

* * *

The first world war had left two vast empires in a quandary. The Celestial
Empire of China, the oldest continuous state in the world, and the Empire of
the Tsars, a much more recent operation, hovered shakily between the prospect
of turning themselves into nation-states and the prospect of decomposing into
smaller units, like their Ottoman and Hapsburg counterparts had done.

Lenin resolved this quandary for Russia. Is such a thing possible? Marx had
observed that a single individual could not change circumstances; he could
only avail himself of them. Marx was probably right. Lenin’s feat was not to
change circumstances, but to avail himself of them in an extraordinary manner.
The feat was monumental in its opportunism.

Lenin was a Russian bourgeois who cursed the weakness and ineptitude of the
Russian bourgeoisie.[^4] An enthusiast for capitalist development, an ardent
admirer of American-style progress, he did not make common cause with those he
cursed, but rather with their enemies, with the Anti-capitalist disciples of
Marx. He availed himself of Marx’s blind spot to transform Marx’s critique of
the capitalist production process into a manual for developing capital, a
“how-to-do-it” guide. Marx’s studies of exploitation and immiseration became
food for the famished, a cornucopia, a virtual horn of plenty. American
businessmen had already marketed urine as spring water, but no American
confidence man had yet managed an inversion of such magnitude.

No circumstances were changed. Every step of the inversion was carried out
with available circumstances, with tried and tested methods. Russian
countryfolk could not be mobilized in terms of their Russianness or orthodoxy
or whiteness, but they could be, and were, mobilized in terms of their
exploitation, their oppression, their ages of suffering under the despotism of
the Tsars. Oppression and exploitation became welding materials. The long
sufferings under the Tsars were used in the same way and for the same purpose
as the scalpings of white women and children had been used by Americans; they
were used to organize people into fighting units, into embryos of the national
army and the national police.

The presentation of the dictator and of the Party’s central committee as a
dictatorship of the liberated proletariat seemed to be something new, but even
this was new only in the words that were used. This was something as old as
the Pharaohs and Lugals of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, who had been chosen
by the god to lead the people, who had embodied the people in their dialogues
with the god. This was a tried and tested gimmick of rulers. Even if the
ancient precedents were temporarily forgotten, a more recent precedent had
been provided by the French Committee of Public Health, which had presented
itself as the embodiment of the nation’s general will.

The goal, communism, the overthrow and supersession of capitalism, also seemed
something new, seemed to be a change of circumstances. But only the word was
new. the goal of the dictator of the proletariat was still American-style
progress, capitalist development, electrification, rapid mass transportation,
science, the processing of the natural environment. The goal was the
capitalism that the weak and inept Russian bourgeoisie had failed to develop.
With Marx’s Capital as their light and guide, the dictator and his Party would
develop capitalism in Russia; they would serve as a substitute bourgeoisie,
and they would use the power of the state not only to police the process, but
to launch and manage it as well.

Lenin did not live long enough to demonstrate his virtuosity as general
manager of Russian capital, but his successor Stalin amply demonstrated the
powers of the founder’s machine. The fist step was the primitive accumulation
of capital. If Marx had not been very clear about this, Preobrazhensky had
been very clear. Preobrazhensky was jailed, but his description of the tried
and tested methods of procuring preliminary capital was applied to vast
Russia. The preliminary capital of English, American, Belgian and other
capitalists had come from plundered overseas colonies. Russia had no overseas
colonies. This lack was no obstacle. The entire Russian countryside was
transformed into a colony.

The first sources of preliminary capital were Kulaks, peasants who had
something worth plundering. This drive was so successful that it was applied
to the remaining peasants as well, with the rational expectation that small
amounts plundered from many people would yield a substantial hoard.

The peasants were not the only colonials. The former ruling class had already
been thoroughly expropriated of all its wealth and property, but yet other
sources of preliminary capital were found. With the totality of state power
concentrated in their hands, the dictators soon discovered that they could
manufacture sources of primitive accumulation. Successful entrepreneurs,
dissatisfied workers and peasants, militants of competing organizations, even
disillusioned Party Members, could be designated as counterrevolutionaries,
rounded up, expropriated and shipped off to labor camps. All the deportations,
mass executions and expropriations of earlier colonizers were re-enacted in
Russia.

Earlier colonizers, being pioneers, had resorted to trial and error. The
Russian dictators did not have to resort to trial and error. By their time,
all the methods of procuring preliminary capital had been tried and tested,
and could be scientifically applied. Russian capital developed in a totally
controlled environment, a hothouse; every lever, every variable, was
controlled by the national police. Functions which had been left to chance or
to other bodies in less controlled environments fell to the police in the
Russian hothouse. The fact that the colonials were not abroad but within, and
therefore subject not to conquest but to arrest, further increased the role
and size of the police. In time the omnipotent and omnipresent police became
the visible emanation and embodiment of the proletariat, and communism became
a synonym of total police organization and control.

* * *

Lenin’s expectations were not, however, fully realized by the Russian
hothouse. The police-as-capitalist worked wonders in procuring preliminary
capital from expropriated counterrevolutionaries, but did not do nearly as
well in managing the capitalist production process. It may still be too early
to tell for sure, but to date this police bureaucracy had been at least as
inept in this role as the bourgeoisie Lenin had cursed; its ability to
discover ever new sources of preliminary capital seems to be all that has kept
it afloat.

Nor has the appeal of this apparatus been on a level with Lenin’s
expectations. The Leninist police apparatus has not appealed to businessmen or
to established politicians; it has not recommended itself as a superior method
of managing the production process. It has appealed to a somewhat different
social class, a class I will briefly try to describe, and it has recommended
itself to this class primarily as a method of seizing national power and
secondarily as a method of primitive accumulation of capital.

The heirs of Lenin and Stalin have not been actual Praetorian guards, actual
wielders of economic and political power in the name and for the benefit of a
superfluous monarch; they have been understudy Praetorians, students of
economic and political power who despaired of ever reaching even intermediate
levels of power. The Leninist model has offered such people the prospect of
leaping over the intermediate levels directly into the central palace.

The heirs of Lenin were clerks and minor officials, people like Mussolini, Mao
Zedong and Hitler, people who, like Lenin himself, cursed their weak and inept
bourgeoisies for having failed to establish their nation’s greatness.

(I do not include the Zionists among the heirs of Lenin because they belong to
an earlier generation. They were Lenin’s contemporaries who had, perhaps
independently, discovered the power of persecution and suffering as welding
materials for the mobilization of a national army and police. The Zionists
made other contributions of their own. Their treatment of a dispersed
religious population as a nation, their imposition of the capitalist
nation-state as that population’s end-all and be-all, and their reduction of a
religious heritage to a racial heritage, contributed significant elements to
the nationalist methodology, and would have fateful consequences when they
were applied on a population of Jews, not all of them Zionists, by a
population welded together as a “German race.”) Mussolini, Mao Zedong and
Hitler cut through the curtain of slogans and saw Lenin’s and Stalin’s feats
for what they were: successful methods of seizing and maintaining state power.
All three trimmed the methodology down to its essentials. The first step was
to join up with likeminded students of power and to form the nucleus of the
police organization, an outfit called, after Lenin’s, the Party. The next step
was to recruit the mass base, the available troops and troop suppliers. The
third step was to seize the apparatus of the state, to install the
theoretician in the office of Duce, Chairman or Fuehrer, to apportion police
and managerial functions among the elite or cadre, and to put the mass base to
work. The fourth step was to secure the preliminary capital needed to repair
or launch a military-industrial complex capable of supporting the national
leader and cadre, the police and army, the industrial managers; without this
capital there could be no weapons, no power, no nation.

The heirs of Lenin and Stalin further trimmed the methodology, in their
recruiting drives, by minimizing capitalist exploitation and by concentrating
on national oppression. Talk of exploitation no longer served a purpose, and
had in fact become embarrassing, since it was obvious to all, especially to
wage workers, that successful revolutionaries had not put an end to wage
labor, but had extended its domain.

Being as pragmatic as American businessmen, the new revolutionaries did not
speak of liberation from wage labor, but of national liberation.[^5] This type
of liberation was not a dream of romantic utopians; it was precisely what was
possible, and all that was passible, in the existing world, one needed only to
avail oneself of already existing circumstances to make it happen. National
liberation consisted of the liberation of the national chairman and the
national police from the chains of powerlessness; the investiture of the
chairman and the establishment of the police were not pipe dreams but
components of a tried and tested strategy, a science.

Fascist and National Socialist Parties were the first to prove that the
strategy worked, that the Bolshevik Party’s feat could actually be repeated.
The national chairmen and their staffs installed themselves in power and set
out to procure the preliminary capital needed for national greatness. The
Fascists thrust themselves into one of the last uninvaded regions of Africa
and gouged it as earlier industrializers had gouged their colonial empires.
The National Socialists targeted Jews, an inner population that had been
members of a “unified Germany” as long as other Germans, as their first source
of primitive accumulation because many of the Jews, like many of Stalin’s
Kulaks, had things worth plundering.

Zionists had already preceded the National Socialists in reducing a religion
to a race, and National Socialists could look back to American pioneers for
ways to use the instrument of racism. Hitler’s elite needed only to translate
the corpus of American racist research to equip their scientific institutes
with large libraries. The National Socialists dealt with Jews much the same
way as the Americans had earlier dealt with the indigenous population of North
America, except that the National Socialists applied a later and much more
powerful technology to the task of deporting, expropriating and exterminating
human beings. But in this the later exterminators were not innovators; they
merely availed themselves of the circumstances within their reach.

The Fascists and National Socialists were joined by Japanese empire-builders
who feared that the decomposing Celestial Empire would become a source of
preliminary capital for Russian or revolutionary Chinese industrializers.
Forming an Axis, the three set out to turn the world’s continents into sources
of primitive accumulation of capital. They were not bothered by other nations
until they started to encroach on the colonies and homelands of established
capitalist powers. The reduction of already established capitalists to
colonized prey could be practiced internally, where it was always legal since
the nation’s rulers make its laws — and had already been practiced internally
by Leninists and Stalinists. But such a practice would have amounted to a
change of circumstances, and it could not be carried abroad without provoking
a world war. The Axis powers overreached themselves and lost.

After the war, many reasonable people would speak of the aims of the Axis as
irrational and of Hitler as a lunatic. Yet the same reasonable people would
consider men like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson sane and rational,
even though these men envisioned and began to enact the conquest of a vast
continent, the deportation and extermination of the continent’s population, at
a time when such a project was much less feasible than the project of the
Axis.[^6] It is true that the technologies as well as the physical, chemical,
biological and social sciences applied by Washington and Jefferson were quite
different from those applied by the National Socialists. But if knowledge is
power, if it was rational for the earlier pioneers to maim and kill with
gunpowder in the age of horse-drawn carriages, why was it irrational for
National Socialists to maim and kill with high explosives, gas and chemical
agents in the age of rockets, submarines and ‘freeways’?

The Nazis were, if anything, yet more scientifically-oriented than the
Americans. In their time, they were a synonym for scientific efficiency to
much of the world. They kept files on everything, tabulated and cross
tabulated their findings, published their tabulations in scientific journals.
Among them, even racism was not the property of frontier rabble-rousers, but
of well-endowed institutes.

Many reasonable people seem to equate lunacy with failure. This would not be
the first time. Many called Napoleon a lunatic when he was in prison or in
exile, but when Napoleon re-emerged as the Emperor, the same people spoke of
him with respect, even reverence. Incarceration and exile are not only
regarded as remedies for lunacy, but also as its symptoms. Failure is
foolishness.

* * *

Mao Zedong, the third pioneering national socialist (or national communist;
the second word no longer matters, since it is nothing but a historical relic;
the expression “left-wing fascist” would serve as well, but it conveys even
less meaning than the nationalist expressions) succeeded in doing for the
Celestial Empire what Lenin had done for the Empire of the Tsars. The oldest
bureaucratic apparatus in the world did not decompose into smaller units nor
into colonies of other industrializers; it reemerged, greatly changed, as a
People’s Republic, as a beacon to “oppressed nations.”

The Chairman and his Cadre followed the footsteps of a long line of
predecessors and transformed the Celestial Empire into a vast source of
preliminary capital, complete with purges, persecutions and their consequent
great leaps forward.

The next stage, the launching of the capitalist production process, was
carried out on the Russian model, namely by the national police. This did not
work in China any better than it had in Russia. Apparently the entrepreneurial
function was to be entrusted to confidence men or hustlers who are able to
take other people in, and cops do not usually inspire the required confidence.
But this was less important to Maoists than it had been to Leninists. The
capitalist production process remains important, at least as important as the
regularized drives for primitive accumulation, since without the capital there
is no power, no nation. But the Maoists make few, and ever fewer, claims for
their model as a superior method of industrialization, and in this they are
more modest than the Russians and less disappointed by the results of their
industrial police.

The Maoist model offers itself to security guards and students the world over
as a tried and tested methodology of power, as a scientific strategy of
national liberation. Generally known as Mao-Zedong-Thought,[^7] this science
offers aspiring chairmen and cadres the prospect of unprecedented power over
living beings, human activities and even thoughts. The pope and priests of the
Catholic Church, with all their inquisitions and confessions, never had such
power, not because they would have rejected it, but because they lacked the
instruments made available by modern science and technology.

The liberation of the nation is the last stage in the elimination of
parasites. Capitalism and already earlier cleared nature of parasites and
reduced most of the rest of nature to raw materials for processing industries.
Modern national socialism or social nationalism holds out the prospect of
eliminating parasites from human society as well. The human parasites are
usually sources of preliminary capital, but the capital is not always
‘material’; it can also be cultural or ‘spiritual’. The ways, myths, poetry
and music of the people are liquidated as a matter of course; some of the
music and costumes of the former “folk culture” subsequently reappear,
processed and packaged, as elements of the national spectacle, as decorations
for the national accumulation drives; the ways and myths become raw materials
for processing by one or several of the “human sciences.” Even the useless
resentment of workers toward their alienated wage labor is liquidated. When
the nation is liberated, wage labor ceases to be an onerous burden and becomes
a national obligation, to be carried out with joy. The inmates of a totally
liberated nation read Orwell’s 1984 as an anthropological study, a description
of an earlier age.

It is no longer possible to satirize this state of affairs. Every satire risks
becoming a bible for yet another national liberation front.[^8] Every satirist
risks becoming the founder of a new religion, a Buddha, Zarathustra, Jesus,
Muhammad or Marx. Every exposure of the ravages of the dominant system, every
critique of the system’s functioning, becomes fodder for the horses of
liberators, welding materials for builders of armies. Mao-Zedong-Thought in
its numerous versions and revisions is a total science as well as a total
theology; it is social physics as well as cosmic metaphysics. The French
Committee of National Health claimed to embody the general will of only the
French nation. The revisions of Mao-Zedong-Thought claim to embody the general
will of all the world’s oppressed.

The constant revisions of this Thought are necessary because its initial
formulations were not applicable to all, or in fact to any, of the world’s
colonized populations. None of the world’s colonized shared the Chinese
heritage of having supported a state apparatus for the past two thousand
years. Few of the world’s oppressed had possessed any of the attributes of a
nation in the recent or distant past. The Thought had to be adapted to people
whose ancestors had lived without national chairmen, armies or police, without
capitalist production processes and therefore without the need for preliminary
capital.

These revisions were accomplished by enriching the initial Thought with
borrowings from Mussolini, Hitler and the Zionist state of Israel. Mussolini’s
theory of the fulfillment of the nation in the state was a central tenet. All
groups of people, whether small or large, industrial or non-industrial,
concentrated or dispersed, were seen as nations, not in terms of their past,
but in terms of their aura, their potentiality, a potentiality embedded in
their national liberation fronts. Hitler’s (and the Zionists’) treatment of
the nation as a racial entity was another central tenet. The cadres were
recruited from among people depleted of their ancestors’ kinships and customs,
and consequently the liberators were not distinguishable from the oppressors
in terms of language, beliefs, customs or weapons; the only welding material
that held them to each other and to their mass base was the welding material
that had held white servants to white bosses on the American frontier; the
“racial bond” gave identities to those without identity, kinship to those who
had no kin, community to those who had lost their community; it was the last
bond of the culturally depleted.

* * *

The revised thought could now be applied to Africans as well as Navahos,
Apaches as well as Palestinians.[^9] The borrowings from Mussolini, Hitler and
the Zionists are judiciously covered up, because Mussolini and Hitler failed
to hold on to their seized power, and because the successful Zionists have
turned their state into the world’s policeman against all other national
liberation fronts. Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong must be given even more credit
than they deserve.

The revised and universally applicable models work much the same as the
originals, but more smoothly; national liberation has become an applied
science; the apparatus has been frequently tested; the numerous kinks in the
originals have by now been straightened out. All that is needed to make the
contraption run is a driver, a transmission belt, and fuel.

The driver is of course the theoretician himself, or his closest disciple. The
transmission belt is the general staff, the organization, also called the
Party or the communist party. This communist party with a small c is exactly
what it is popularly understood to be. It is the nucleus of the police
organization that does the purging and that will itself be purged once the
leader becomes National Leader and needs to re-revise the invariant Thought
while adapting himself to the family of nations, or at least to the family
bankers, munitions suppliers and investors. And the fuel: the oppressed
nation, the suffering masses, the liberated people are and will continue to be
the fuel.

The leader and the general staff are not flown in from abroad; they are not
foreign agitators. They are integral products of the capitalist production
process. This production process has invariably been accompanied by racism.
Racism is not a necessary component of production, but racism (in some form)
has been a necessary component of the process of primitive accumulation of
capital, and it has almost always leaked into the production process.

Industrialized nations have procured their preliminary capital by
expropriating, deporting, persecuting and segregating, if not always by
exterminating, people designated as legitimate prey. Kinships were broken,
environments were destroyed, cultural orientations and ways were extirpated.

Descendants of survivors of such onslaughts are lucky if they preserve the
merest relics, the most fleeting shadows of their ancestors’ cultures. Many of
the descendants do not retain even shadows; they are totally depleted; they go
to work; they further enlarge the apparatus that destroyed their ancestors’
culture. And in the world of work they are relegated to the margins, to the
most unpleasant and least highly paid jobs. This makes them mad. A supermarket
packer, for example, may know more about the stocks and the ordering than the
manager, may know that racism is the only reason he is not manager and the
manager not a packer. A security guard may know racism is the only reason he’s
not chief of police. It is among people who have lost all their roots, who
dream themselves supermarket managers and chiefs of police, that the national
liberation front takes root; this is where the leader and general staff are
formed.

Nationalism continues to appeal to the depleted because other prospects appear
bleaker. The culture of the ancestors was destroyed; therefore, by pragmatic
standard, it failed; the only ancestors who survived were those who
accommodated themselves to the invader’s system, and they survived on the
outskirts of garbage dumps. The varied utopias of poets and dreamers and the
numerous “mythologies of the proletariat” have also failed; they have not
proven themselves in practice; they have been nothing but hot air, pipe
dreams, pies in the sky; the actual proletariat has been as racist as the
bosses and the police.

The packer and the security guard have lost contact with the ancient culture;
pipe dreams and utopias don’t interest them, are in fact dismissed with the
practical businessman’s contempt toward poets, drifters and dreamers.
Nationalism offers them something concrete, something that’s been tried and
tested and is known to work. There’s no earthly reason for the descendants of
the persecuted to remain persecuted when nationalism offers them the prospect
of becoming persecutors. Near and distant relatives of victims can become a
racist nation-state; they can themselves herd other people into concentration
camps, push other people around at will, perpetrate genocidal war against
them, procure preliminary capital by expropriating them. And if “racial
relatives” of Hitler’s victims can do it, so can the near and distant
relatives of the victims of a Washington, Jackson, Reagan or Begin.

Every oppressed population can become a nation, a photographic negative of the
oppressor nation, a place where the former packer is the supermarket’s
manager, where the former security guard is the chief of police. By applying
the corrected strategy, every security guard can follow the precedent of
ancient Rome’s Praetorian guards. The security police of a foreign mining
trust can proclaim itself a republic, liberate the people, and go on
liberating them until they have nothing left but to pray for liberation to
end. Even before the seizure of power, a gang can call itself a Front and
offer heavily taxed and constantly policed poor people something they still
lack: a tribute-gathering organization and a hit-squad, namely supplementary
tax farmers and police, the people’s own. In these ways, people can be
liberated of the traits of their victimized ancestors; all the relics that
still survive from pre-industrial times and non-capitalist cultures can at
last be permanently extirpated.

The idea that an understanding of the genocide, that a memory of the
holocausts, can only lead people to want to dismantle the system, is
erroneous. The continuing appeal of nationalism suggests that the opposite is
truer, namely that an understanding of genocide has led people to mobilize
genocidal armies, that the memory of holocausts has led people to perpetrate
holocausts. The sensitive poets who remembered the loss, the researchers who
documented it, have been like the pure scientists who discovered the structure
of the atom. Applied scientists used the discovery to split the atom’s
nucleus, to produce weapons which can split every atom’s nucleus; Nationalists
used the poetry to split and fuse human populations, to mobilize genocidal
armies, to perpetrate new holocausts.

The pure scientist, poets and researchers consider themselves innocent of the
devastated countrysides and charred bodies. Are they innocent?

It seems to me that at least one of Marx’s observations is true: every minute
devoted to the capitalist production process, every thought contributed to the
industrial system, further enlarges a power that is inimical to nature, to
culture, to life. Applied science is not something alien; it is an integral
part of the capitalist production process. Nationalism is not flown in from
abroad. It is a product of the capitalist production process, like the
chemical agents poisoning the lakes, air, animals and people, like the nuclear
plants radioactivating micro-environments in preparation for the
radioactivation of the macro-environment.

As a postscript I’d like to answer a question before it is asked. The question
is: “Don’t you think a descendant of oppressed people is better off as a
supermarket manager or police chief?” My answer is another question: What
concentration camp manager, national executioner or torturer is not a
descendant of oppressed people?

    “Manual” came from aspiring national liberators, and it is possible that
    some of the current versions of the nationalist metaphysic contain recipes
    offered by Michael Velli.

[^9]: I am not exaggerating. I have before me a book-length pamphlet titled
    *The Mythology of the White Proletariat: A Short Course for Understanding
    Babylon* by J. Sakai (Chicago: Morningstar Press, 1983). As an application
    of Mao-Zedong-Thought to American history, it is the most sensitive Maoist
    work I’ve seen. The author documents and describes, sometimes vividly, the
    oppression of America’s enslaved Africans, the deportations and
    exterminations of the American continent’s indigenous inhabitants, the
    racist exploitation of Chinese, the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in
    concentration camps. The author mobilizes all these experiences of
    unmitigated terror, not to look for ways to supersede the system that
    perpetrated them, but to urge the victims to reproduce the same system
    among themselves. Sprinkled with pictures and quotations of chairmen
    Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Ho-chi Minh, this work makes no attempt to
    hide or disguise its repressive aims; it urges Africans as well as
    Navahos, Apaches as well as Palestinians, to organize a party, seize state
    power, and liquidate parasites.
