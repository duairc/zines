## Translator’s Note

There have been several previous English translations of *The Society of the
Spectacle*. I have gone through them all and have retained whatever seemed
already to be adequate. In particular, I have adopted quite a few of Donald
Nicholson-Smith’s renderings, though I have diverged from him in many other
cases. His translation (Zone Books, 1994) and the earlier one by Fredy Perlman
and John Supak (Black and Red, 1977) are both in print, and both can also be
found at the Situationist International Online website.

I believe that my translation conveys Debord’s actual meaning more accurately,
as well as more clearly and idiomatically, than any of the other versions. I
am nevertheless aware that it is far from perfect, and welcome any criticisms
or suggestions.

If you find the opening chapters too difficult, you might try starting with
Chapter 4 or Chapter 5. As you see how Debord deals with concrete historical
events, you may get a better idea of the practical implications of ideas that
are presented more abstractly in the other chapters.

The book is not, however, as difficult or abstract as it is reputed to be. It
is not an ivory-tower academic or philosophical discourse. It is an effort to
clarify the nature of the society in which we find ourselves and the
advantages and drawbacks of various methods for changing it. Every single
thesis has a direct or indirect bearing on issues that are matters of life and
death. Chapter 4, which with remarkable conciseness sums up the lessons of two
centuries of revolutionary experience, is simply the most obvious example.

  ~ In answer to a number of queries I have received: At the moment I have no
    plans to publish this translation in book form. For one thing, I’m not yet
    completely satisfied with it, and will be fine-tuning it over the next few
    months. Then I may start considering different publication possibilities,
    depending on what sort of interest has been expressed.

    Another reason is that Alice Debord has asked me to prepare new
    translations of all of Debord’s films, to be used in subtitling them for
    English-speaking audiences. One of those films, of course, is based on
    this book, so I will want to get that taken care of (which may involve
    minor last-minute changes in the portions of the book that are used in the
    film) before thinking about book publication.

July 2002
  ~ During the last few weeks I have made a considerable number of stylistic
    revisions in the *Society of the Spectacle* translation. Although I will
    continue to make any improvements that occur to me, the translation as it
    now stands is probably pretty close to final.

January 2005
  ~ A book edition of this translation has been published in England by Rebel
    Press. (*Note:* In the first printing of this edition the publisher
    erroneously referred to this as “a new authorized translation.” The
    translation was in fact done independently and was not authorized. The
    first printing also begins Chapter 2 with thesis \#38. It should begin
    with \#35. Both of these errors have been corrected in the second
    printing.)

# Chapter 1: The Culmination of Separation

> “But for the present age, which prefers the sign to the thing signified, the
> copy to the original, representation to reality, appearance to essence…
> truth is considered *profane*, and only *illusion* is *sacred*. Sacredness
> is in fact held to be enhanced in proportion as truth decreases and illusion
> increases, so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest
> degree of sacredness.”

> — Feuerbach, Preface to the second edition of *The Essence of Christianity*

**1.** In societies dominated by modern conditions of production, life is
presented as an immense accumulation of *spectacles*. Everything that was
directly lived has receded into a representation.

**2.** The images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common
stream in which the unity of that life can no longer be recovered.
*Fragmented* views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a
*separate pseudoworld* that can only be looked at. The specialization of
images of the world evolves into a world of autonomized images where even the
deceivers are deceived. The spectacle is a concrete inversion of life, an
autonomous movement of the nonliving.

**3.** The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as society itself, as a
part of society, and as a *means of unification*. As a part of society, it is
the focal point of all vision and all consciousness. But due to the very fact
that this sector is *separate*, it is in reality the domain of delusion and
false consciousness: the unification it achieves is nothing but an official
language of universal separation.

**4.** The spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation
between people that is mediated by images.

**5.** The spectacle cannot be understood as a mere visual excess produced by
mass-media technologies. It is a worldview that has actually been
materialized, a view of a world that has become objective.

**6.** Understood in its totality, the spectacle is both the result and the
project of the dominant mode of production. It is not a mere decoration added
to the real world. It is the very heart of this real society’s unreality. In
all of its particular manifestations — news, propaganda, advertising,
entertainment — the spectacle represents the dominant *model* of life. It is
the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have *already been made* in
the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that production. In
both form and content the spectacle serves as a total justification of the
conditions and goals of the existing system. The spectacle also represents the
*constant presence* of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of
the time spent outside the production process.

**7.** Separation is itself an integral part of the unity of this world, of a
global social practice split into reality and image. The social practice
confronted by an autonomous spectacle is at the same time the real totality
which contains that spectacle. But the split within this totality mutilates it
to the point that the spectacle seems to be its goal. The language of the
spectacle consists of *signs* of the dominant system of production — signs
which are at the same time the ultimate end-products of that system.

**8.** The spectacle cannot be abstractly contrasted to concrete social
activity. Each side of such a duality is itself divided. The spectacle that
falsifies reality is nevertheless a real product of that reality. Conversely,
real life is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle, and
ends up absorbing it and aligning itself with it. Objective reality is present
on both sides. Each of these seemingly fixed concepts has no other basis than
its transformation into its opposite: reality emerges within the spectacle,
and the spectacle is real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and
support of the existing society.

**9.** In a world that is *really upside down*, the true is a moment of the
false.

**10.** The concept of “the spectacle” interrelates and explains a wide range
of seemingly unconnected phenomena. The apparent diversities and contrasts of
these phenomena stem from the social organization of appearances, whose
essential nature must itself be recognized. Considered in its own terms, the
spectacle is an *affirmation* of appearances and an identification of all
human social life with appearances. But a critique that grasps the spectacle’s
essential character reveals it to be a visible *negation* of life — a negation
that has taken on a *visible form*.

**11.** In order to describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions, and
the forces that work against it, it is necessary to make some artificial
distinctions. In *analyzing* the spectacle we are obliged to a certain extent
to use the spectacle’s own language, in the sense that we have to operate on
the methodological terrain of the society that expresses itself in the
spectacle. For the spectacle is both the *meaning* and the *agenda* of our
particular socio-economic formation. It is the historical moment in which we
are caught.

**12.** The spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can
never be questioned. Its sole message is: “What appears is good; what is good
appears.” The passive acceptance it demands is already effectively imposed by
its monopoly of appearances, its manner of appearing without allowing any
reply.

**13.** The tautological character of the spectacle stems from the fact that
its means and ends are identical. It is the sun that never sets over the
empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire surface of the globe,
endlessly basking in its own glory.

**14.** The society based on modern industry is not accidentally or
superficially spectacular, it is *fundamentally spectaclist*. In the spectacle
— the visual reflection of the ruling economic order — goals are nothing,
development is everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself.

**15.** As indispensable embellishment of currently produced objects, as
general articulation of the system’s rationales, and as advanced economic
sector that directly creates an ever-increasing mass of image-objects, the
spectacle is the *leading production* of present-day society.

**16.** The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the
economy has already totally subjugated them. It is nothing other than the
economy developing for itself. It is at once a faithful reflection of the
production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.

**17.** The first stage of the economy’s domination of social life brought
about an evident degradation of *being* into *having* — human fulfillment was
no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed. The present
stage, in which social life has become completely dominated by the accumulated
productions of the economy, is bringing about a general shift from *having* to
*appearing* — all “having” must now derive its immediate prestige and its
ultimate purpose from appearances. At the same time all individual reality has
become social, in the sense that it is shaped by social forces and is directly
dependent on them. Individual reality is allowed to appear only if it is *not
actually real*.

**18.** When the real world is transformed into mere images, mere images
become real beings — dynamic figments that provide the direct motivations for
a hypnotic behavior. Since the spectacle’s job is to use various specialized
mediations in order to *show* us a world that can no longer be directly
grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special preeminence
once occupied by touch: the most abstract and easily deceived sense is the
most readily adaptable to the generalized abstraction of present-day society.
But the spectacle is not merely a matter of images, nor even of images plus
sounds. It is whatever escapes people’s activity, whatever eludes their
practical reconsideration and correction. It is the opposite of dialogue.
Wherever *representation* becomes independent, the spectacle regenerates
itself.

**19.** The spectacle inherits the *weakness* of the Western philosophical
project, which attempted to understand activity by means of the categories of
*vision*, and it is based on the relentless development of the particular
technical rationality that grew out of that form of thought. The spectacle
does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes reality, reducing everyone’s
concrete life to a universe of *speculation*.

**20.** Philosophy — the power of separate thought and the thought of separate
power — was never by itself able to supersede theology. The spectacle is the
material reconstruction of the religious illusion. Spectacular technology has
not dispersed the religious mists into which human beings had projected their
own alienated powers, it has merely brought those mists down to earth, to the
point that even the most mundane aspects of life have become impenetrable and
unbreathable. The illusory paradise that represented a total denial of earthly
life is no longer projected into the heavens, it is embedded in earthly life
itself. The spectacle is the technological version of the exiling of human
powers into a “world beyond”; the culmination of humanity’s *internal*
separation.

**21.** As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain a
social necessity. The spectacle is the bad dream of a modern society in chains
and ultimately expresses nothing more than its wish for sleep. The spectacle
is the guardian of that sleep.

**22.** The fact that the practical power of modern society has detached
itself from that society and established an independent realm in the spectacle
can be explained only by the additional fact that that powerful practice
continued to lack cohesion and had remained in contradiction with itself.

**23.** The root of the spectacle is that oldest of all social
specializations, the specialization of *power*. The spectacle plays the
specialized role of speaking in the name of all the other activities. It is
hierarchical society’s ambassador to itself, delivering its official messages
at a court where no one else is allowed to speak. The most modern aspect of
the spectacle is thus also the most archaic.

**24.** The spectacle is the ruling order’s nonstop discourse about itself,
its never-ending monologue of self-praise, its self-portrait at the stage of
totalitarian domination of all aspects of life. The fetishistic appearance of
pure objectivity in spectacular relations conceals their true character as
relations between people and between classes: a second Nature, with its own
inescapable laws, seems to dominate our environment. But the spectacle is not
the inevitable consequence of some supposedly natural technological
development. On the contrary, the society of the spectacle is a form that
chooses its own technological content. If the spectacle, considered in the
limited sense of the “mass media” that are its most glaring superficial
manifestation, seems to be invading society in the form of a mere technical
apparatus, it should be understood that this apparatus is in no way neutral
and that it has been developed in accordance with the spectacle’s internal
dynamics. If the social needs of the age in which such technologies are
developed can be met only through their mediation, if the administration of
this society and all contact between people has become totally dependent on
these means of instantaneous communication, it is because this “communication”
is essentially *unilateral*. The concentration of these media thus amounts to
concentrating in the hands of the administrators of the existing system the
means that enable them to carry on this particular form of administration. The
social separation reflected in the spectacle is inseparable from the modern
*state* — the product of the social division of labor that is both the chief
instrument of class rule and the concentrated expression of all social
divisions.

**25.** *Separation* is the alpha and omega of the spectacle. The
institutionalization of the social division of labor in the form of class
divisions had given rise to an earlier, religious form of contemplation: the
mythical order with which every power has always camouflaged itself. Religion
justified the cosmic and ontological order that corresponded to the interests
of the masters, expounding and embellishing everything their societies *could
not deliver*. In this sense, all separate power has been spectacular. But this
earlier universal devotion to a fixed religious imagery was only a shared
acknowledgment of loss, an imaginary compensation for the poverty of a
concrete social activity that was still generally experienced as a unitary
condition. In contrast, the modern spectacle depicts what society *could*
deliver, but in so doing it rigidly separates what is *possible* from what is
*permitted*. The spectacle keeps people in a state of unconsciousness as they
pass through practical changes in their conditions of existence. Like a
factitious god, it engenders itself and makes its own rules. It reveals itself
for what it *is:* an autonomously developing separate power, based on the
increasing productivity resulting from an increasingly refined division of
labor into parcelized gestures dictated by the independent movement of
machines, and working for an ever-expanding market. In the course of this
development, all community and all critical awareness have disintegrated; and
the forces that were able to grow by separating from each other have not yet
been *reunited*.

**26.** The general separation of worker and product tends to eliminate any
direct personal communication between the producers and any comprehensive
sense of what they are producing. With the increasing accumulation of separate
products and the increasing concentration of the productive process,
communication and comprehension are monopolized by the managers of the system.
The triumph of this separation-based economic system *proletarianizes* the
whole world.

**27.** Due to the very success of this separate production of separation, the
fundamental experience that in earlier societies was associated with people’s
primary work is in the process of being replaced (in sectors near the cutting
edge of the system’s evolution) by an identification of life with nonworking
time, with inactivity. But such inactivity is in no way liberated from
productive activity. It remains dependent on it, in an uneasy and admiring
submission to the requirements and consequences of the production system. It
is itself one of the consequences of that system. There can be no freedom
apart from activity, and within the spectacle activity is nullified — all
*real* activity having been forcibly channeled into the global construction of
the spectacle. Thus, what is referred to as a “liberation from work,” namely
the modern increase in leisure time, is neither a liberation of work itself
nor a liberation from the world shaped by this kind of work. None of the
activity stolen by work can be regained by submitting to what that work has
produced.

**28.** The reigning economic system is a *vicious circle of isolation*. Its
technologies are based on isolation, and they contribute to that same
isolation. From automobiles to television, the goods that the spectacular
system *chooses to produce* also serve it as weapons for constantly
reinforcing the conditions that engender “lonely crowds.” With ever-increasing
concreteness the spectacle recreates its own presuppositions.

**29.** The spectacle was born from the world’s loss of unity, and the immense
expansion of the modern spectacle reveals the enormity of this loss. The
abstractifying of all individual labor and the general abstractness of what is
produced are perfectly reflected in the spectacle, whose *manner of being
concrete* is precisely *abstraction*. In the spectacle, a part of the world
*presents itself* to the world and is superior to it. The spectacle is simply
the common language of this separation. Spectators are linked solely by their
one-way relationship to the very center that keeps them isolated from each
other. The spectacle thus reunites the separated, but it reunites them only
*in their separateness*.

**30.** The alienation of the spectator, which reinforces the contemplated
objects that result from his own unconscious activity, works like this: The
more he contemplates, the less he lives; the more he identifies with the
dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and his own
desires. The spectacle’s estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by
the fact that the individual’s gestures are no longer his own; they are the
gestures of someone else who represents them to him. The spectator does not
feel at home anywhere, because the spectacle is everywhere.

**31.** Workers do not produce themselves, they produce a power independent of
themselves. The *success* of this production, the abundance it generates, is
experienced by the producers as an *abundance of dispossession*. As their
alienated products accumulate, all time and space become *foreign* to them.
The spectacle is the map of this new world, a map that is identical to the
territory it represents. The forces that have escaped us *display themselves*
to us in all their power.

**32.** The spectacle’s social function is the concrete manufacture of
alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this
particular sector of industrial production. The “growth” generated by an
economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the
very alienation that was at its origin.

**33.** Though separated from what they produce, people nevertheless produce
every detail of their world with ever-increasing power. They thus also find
themselves increasingly separated from that world. The closer their life comes
to being their own creation, the more they are excluded from that life.

**34.** The spectacle is *capital* accumulated to the point that it becomes
images.

# Chapter 2: The Commodity as Spectacle

> “The commodity can be understood in its undistorted essence only when it
> becomes the universal category of society as a whole. Only in this context
> does the reification produced by commodity relations assume decisive
> importance both for the objective evolution of society and for the attitudes
> that people adopt toward it, as it subjugates their consciousness to the

> *contemplative*.”
>
> — Lukács, *History and Class Consciousness*

**35.** In the spectacle’s basic practice of incorporating into itself all the
*fluid* aspects of human activity so as to possess them in a congealed form,
and of *inverting* living values into purely abstract values, we recognize our
old enemy *the commodity*, which seems at first glance so trivial and obvious,
yet which is actually so complex and full of metaphysical subtleties.

**36.** The fetishism of the commodity — the domination of society by
“intangible as well as tangible things” — attains its ultimate fulfillment in
the spectacle, where the real world is replaced by a selection of images which
are projected above it, yet which at the same time succeed in making
themselves regarded as the epitome of reality.

**37.** The world at once present and absent that the spectacle *holds up to
view* is the world of the commodity dominating all living experience. The
world of the commodity is thus shown for *what it is*, because its development
is identical to people’s *estrangement* from each other and from everything
they produce.

**38.** The loss of quality that is so evident at every level of spectacular
language, from the objects it glorifies to the behavior it regulates, stems
from the basic nature of a production system that shuns reality. The commodity
form reduces everything to quantitative equivalence. The quantitative is what
it develops, and it can develop only within the quantitative.

**39.** Despite the fact that this development excludes the qualitative, it is
itself subject to qualitative change. The spectacle reflects the fact that
this development has crossed the threshold of *its own abundance*. Although
this qualitative change has as yet taken place only partially in a few local
areas, it is already implicit at the universal level that was the commodity’s
original standard — a standard that the commodity has lived up to by turning
the whole planet into a single world market.

**40.** The development of productive forces is the *unconscious history* that
has actually created and altered the living conditions of human groups — the
conditions enabling them to survive and the expansion of those conditions. It
has been the economic basis of all human undertakings. Within natural
economies, the emergence of a commodity sector represented a surplus survival.
Commodity production, which implies the exchange of varied products between
independent producers, tended for a long time to retain its small-scale craft
aspects, relegated as it was to a marginal economic role where its
quantitative reality was still hidden. But whenever it encountered the social
conditions of large-scale commerce and capital accumulation, it took total
control of the economy. The entire economy then became what the commodity had
already shown itself to be in the course of this conquest: a process of
quantitative development. This constant expansion of economic power in the
form of commodities transformed human labor itself into a commodity, into
*wage labor*, and ultimately produced a level of abundance sufficient to solve
the initial problem of survival — but only in such a way that the same problem
is continually being regenerated at a higher level. Economic growth has
liberated societies from the natural pressures that forced them into an
immediate struggle for survival; but they have not yet been liberated from
their liberator. The commodity’s *independence* has spread to the entire
economy it now dominates. This economy has transformed the world, but it has
merely transformed it into a world dominated by the economy. The pseudonature
within which human labor has become alienated demands that such labor remain
forever *in its service;* and since this demand is formulated by and
answerable only to itself, it in fact ends up channeling all socially
permitted projects and endeavors into its own reinforcement. The abundance of
commodities — that is, the abundance of commodity relations — amounts to
nothing more than an *augmented survival*.

**41.** As long as the economy’s role as material basis of social life was
neither noticed nor understood (remaining unknown precisely because it was so
familiar), the commodity’s dominion over the economy was exerted in a covert
manner. In societies where actual commodities were few and far between, money
was the apparent master, serving as plenipotentiary representative of the
greater power that remained unknown. With the Industrial Revolution’s
manufactural division of labor and mass production for a global market, the
commodity finally became fully visible as a power that was *colonizing* all
social life. It was at that point that political economy established itself as
the dominant science, and as the science of domination.

**42.** The spectacle is the stage at which the commodity has succeeded in
*totally* colonizing social life. Commodification is not only visible, we no
longer see anything else; the world we see is the world of the commodity.
Modern economic production extends its dictatorship both extensively and
intensively. In the less industrialized regions, its reign is already
manifested by the presence of a few star commodities and by the imperialist
domination imposed by the more industrially advanced regions. In the latter,
social space is blanketed with ever-new layers of commodities. With the
“second industrial revolution,” alienated consumption has become just as much
a duty for the masses as alienated production. The society’s *entire sold
labor* has become a *total commodity* whose constant turnover must be
maintained at all cost. To accomplish this, this total commodity has to be
returned in fragmented form to fragmented individuals who are completely cut
off from the overall operation of the productive forces. To this end the
specialized science of domination is broken down into further specialties such
as sociology, applied psychology, cybernetics, and semiology, which oversee
the self-regulation of every phase of the process.

**43.** Whereas during the primitive stage of capitalist accumulation
“political economy considers the proletarian only as a *worker*,” who only
needs to be allotted the indispensable minimum for maintaining his labor
power, and never considers him “in his leisure and humanity,” this
ruling-class perspective is revised as soon as commodity abundance reaches a
level that requires an additional collaboration from him. Once his workday is
over, the worker is suddenly redeemed from the total contempt toward him that
is so clearly implied by every aspect of the organization and surveillance of
production, and finds himself seemingly treated like a grownup, with a great
show of politeness, in his new role as a consumer. At this point the *humanism
of the commodity* takes charge of the worker’s “leisure and humanity” simply
because political economy now can and must dominate those spheres *as
political economy*. The “perfected denial of man” has thus taken charge of all
human existence.

**44.** The spectacle is a permanent opium war designed to force people to
equate goods with commodities and to equate satisfaction with a survival that
expands according to its own laws. Consumable survival must constantly expand
because it never ceases to *include privation*. If augmented survival never
comes to a resolution, if there is no point where it might stop expanding,
this is because it is itself stuck in the realm of privation. It may gild
poverty, but it cannot transcend it.

**45.** Automation, which is both the most advanced sector of modern industry
and the epitome of its practice, obliges the commodity system to resolve the
following contradiction: The technological developments that objectively tend
to eliminate work must at the same time preserve *labor as a commodity*,
because labor is the only creator of commodities. The only way to prevent
automation (or any other less extreme method of increasing labor productivity)
from reducing society’s total necessary labor time is to create new jobs. To
this end the reserve army of the unemployed is enlisted into the tertiary or
“service” sector, reinforcing the troops responsible for distributing and
glorifying the latest commodities; and in this it is serving a real need, in
the sense that increasingly extensive campaigns are necessary to convince
people to buy increasingly unnecessary commodities.

**46.** Exchange value could arise only as a representative of use value, but
the victory it eventually won with its own weapons created the conditions for
its own autonomous power. By mobilizing all human use value and monopolizing
its fulfillment, exchange value ultimately succeeded in *controlling use*.
Usefulness has come to be seen purely in terms of exchange value, and is now
completely at its mercy. Starting out like a *condottiere* in the service of
use value, exchange value has ended up waging the war for its own sake.

**47.** The constant *decline of use value* that has always characterized the
capitalist economy has given rise to a new form of poverty within the realm of
augmented survival — alongside the old poverty which still persists, since the
vast majority of people are still forced to take part as wage workers in the
unending pursuit of the system’s ends and each of them knows that he must
submit or die. The reality of this blackmail — the fact that even in its most
impoverished forms (food, shelter) use value now has no existence outside the
illusory riches of augmented survival — accounts for the general acceptance of
the illusions of modern commodity consumption. The real consumer has become a
consumer of illusions. The commodity is this materialized illusion, and the
spectacle is its general expression.

**48.** Use value was formerly understood as an implicit aspect of exchange
value. Now, however, within the upside-down world of the spectacle, it must be
explicitly proclaimed, both because its actual reality has been eroded by the
overdeveloped commodity economy and because it serves as a necessary
pseudo-justification for a counterfeit life.

**49.** The spectacle is the flip side of money. It, too, is an abstract
general equivalent of all commodities. But whereas money has dominated society
as the representation of universal equivalence — the exchangeability of
different goods whose uses remain uncomparable — the spectacle is the modern
complement of money: a representation of the commodity world as a whole which
serves as a general equivalent for what the entire society can be and can do.
The spectacle is money one can *only look at*, because in it all use has
already been exchanged for the totality of abstract representation. The
spectacle is not just a servant of *pseudo-use*, it is already in itself a
pseudo-use of life.

**50.** With the achievement of *economic* abundance, the concentrated result
of social labor becomes visible, subjecting all reality to the appearances
that are now that labor’s primary product. Capital is no longer the invisible
center governing the production process; as it accumulates, it spreads to the
ends of the earth in the form of tangible objects. The entire expanse of
society is its portrait.

**51.** The economy’s triumph as an independent power at the same time spells
its own doom, because the forces it has unleashed have eliminated the
*economic necessity* that was the unchanging basis of earlier societies.
Replacing that necessity with a necessity for boundless economic development
can only mean replacing the satisfaction of primary human needs (now scarcely
met) with an incessant fabrication of pseudoneeds, all of which ultimately
come down to the single pseudoneed of maintaining the reign of the autonomous
economy. But that economy loses all connection with authentic needs insofar as
it emerges from the *social unconscious* that unknowingly depended on it.
“Whatever is conscious wears out. What is unconscious remains unalterable. But
once it is freed, it too falls to ruin” (Freud).

**52.** Once society discovers that it depends on the economy, the economy in
fact depends on the society. When the subterranean power of the economy grew
to the point of visible domination, it lost its power. The economic *Id* must
be replaced by the *I*. This subject can only arise out of society, that is,
out of the struggle within society. Its existence depends on the outcome of
the class struggle that is both product and producer of the economic
foundation of history.

**53.** Consciousness of desire and desire for consciousness are the same
project, the project that in its negative form seeks the abolition of classes
and thus the workers’ direct possession of every aspect of their activity. The
*opposite* of this project is the society of the spectacle, where the
commodity contemplates itself in a world of its own making.

**54.** The spectacle, like modern society itself, is at once united and
divided. The unity of each is based on violent divisions. But when this
contradiction emerges in the spectacle, it is itself contradicted by a
reversal of its meaning: the division it presents is unitary, while the unity
it presents is divided.

**55.** Although the struggles between different powers for control of the
same socio-economic system are officially presented as irreconcilable
antagonisms, they actually reflect that system’s fundamental unity, both
internationally and within each nation.

**56.** The sham spectacular struggles between rival forms of separate power
are at the same time real, in that they express the system’s uneven and
conflictual development and the more or less contradictory interests of the
classes or sections of classes that accept that system and strive to carve out
a role for themselves within it. Just as the development of the most advanced
economies involves clashes between different priorities, totalitarian
state-bureaucratic forms of economic management and countries under
colonialism or semicolonialism also exhibit highly divergent types of
production and power. By invoking any number of different criteria, the
spectacle can present these oppositions as totally distinct social systems.
But in reality they are nothing but particular sectors whose fundamental
essence lies in the global system that contains them, the single movement that
has turned the whole planet into its field of operation: capitalism.

**57.** The society that bears the spectacle does not dominate underdeveloped
regions solely by its economic hegemony. It also dominates them *as the
society of the spectacle*. Even where the material base is still absent,
modern society has already used the spectacle to invade the social surface of
every continent. It sets the stage for the formation of indigenous ruling
classes and frames their agendas. Just as it presents pseudogoods to be
coveted, it offers false models of revolution to local revolutionaries. The
bureaucratic regimes in power in certain industrialized countries have their
own particular type of spectacle, but it is an integral part of the total
spectacle, serving as its pseudo-opposition and actual support. Even if local
manifestations of the spectacle include certain totalitarian specializations
of social communication and control, from the standpoint of the overall
functioning of the system those specializations are simply playing their
allotted role within a *global division of spectacular tasks*.

**58.** Although this division of spectacular tasks preserves the existing
order as a whole, it is primarily oriented toward protecting its dominant pole
of development. The spectacle is rooted in the economy of abundance, and the
products of that economy ultimately tend to dominate the spectacular market
and override the ideological or police-state protectionist barriers set up by
local spectacles with pretensions of independence.

**59.** Behind the glitter of spectacular distractions, a tendency toward
*banalization* dominates modern society the world over, even where the more
advanced forms of commodity consumption have seemingly multiplied the variety
of roles and objects to choose from. The vestiges of religion and of the
family (the latter is still the primary mechanism for transferring class power
from one generation to the next), along with the vestiges of moral repression
imposed by those two institutions, can be blended with ostentatious
pretensions of worldly gratification precisely because life in this particular
world remains repressive and offers nothing but pseudo-gratifications.
Complacent acceptance of the status quo may also coexist with purely
spectacular rebelliousness — dissatisfaction itself becomes a commodity as
soon as the economy of abundance develops the capacity to process that
particular raw material.

**60.** Stars — spectacular representations of living human beings — project
this general banality into images of permitted roles. As specialists of
*apparent life*, stars serve as superficial objects that people can identify
with in order to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations that
they actually live. The function of these celebrities is to act out various
lifestyles or sociopolitical viewpoints in a *full, t**otally free manner*.
They embody the inaccessible results of social *labor* by dramatizing the
by-products of that labor which are magically projected above it as its
ultimate goals: *power* and *vacations* — the decisionmaking and consumption
that are at the beginning and the end of a process that is never questioned.
On one hand, a governmental power may personalize itself as a pseudostar; on
the other, a star of consumption may campaign for recognition as a pseudopower
over life. But the activities of these stars are not really free, and they
offer no real choices.

**61.** The agent of the spectacle who is put on stage as a star is the
opposite of an individual; he is as clearly the enemy of his own individuality
as of the individuality of others. Entering the spectacle as a model to be
identified with, he renounces all autonomous qualities in order to identify
himself with the general law of obedience to the succession of things. The
stars of consumption, though outwardly representing different personality
types, actually show each of these types enjoying equal access to, and
deriving equal happiness from, the entire realm of consumption. The stars of
decisionmaking must possess the full range of admired human qualities:
official differences between them are thus canceled out by the official
similarity implied by their supposed excellence in every field of endeavor. As
head of state, Khrushchev retrospectively became a general so as to take
credit for the victory of the battle of Kursk twenty years after it happened.
And Kennedy survived as an orator to the point of delivering his own funeral
oration, since Theodore Sorenson continued to write speeches for his successor
in the same style that had contributed so much toward the dead man’s public
persona. The admirable people who personify the system are well known for not
being what they seem; they attain greatness by stooping below the reality of
the most insignificant individual life, and everyone knows it.

**62.** The false choices offered by spectacular abundance — choices based on
the juxtaposition of competing yet mutually reinforcing spectacles and of
distinct yet interconnected roles (signified and embodied primarily by
objects) — develop into struggles between illusory qualities designed to
generate fervent allegiance to quantitative trivialities. Fallacious archaic
oppositions are revived — regionalisms and racisms which serve to endow
mundane rankings in the hierarchies of consumption with a magical ontological
superiority — and pseudoplayful enthusiasms are aroused by an endless
succession of ludicrous competitions, from sports to elections. Wherever
abundant consumption is established, one particular spectacular opposition is
always in the forefront of illusory roles: the antagonism between youth and
adults. But real adults — people who are masters of their own lives — are in
fact nowhere to be found. And a youthful transformation of what exists is in
no way characteristic of those who are now young; it is present solely in the
economic system, in the dynamism of capitalism. It is *things* that rule and
that are young, vying with each other and constantly replacing each other.

**63.** Spectacular oppositions conceal the *unity of poverty*. If different
forms of the same alienation struggle against each other in the guise of
irreconcilable antagonisms, this is because they are all based on real
contradictions that are repressed. The spectacle exists in a *concentrated*
form and a *diffuse* form, depending on the requirements of the particular
stage of poverty it denies and supports. In both cases it is nothing more than
an image of happy harmony surrounded by desolation and horror, at the calm
center of misery.

**64.** The concentrated spectacle is primarily associated with bureaucratic
capitalism, though it may also be imported as a technique for reinforcing
state power in more backward mixed economies or even adopted by advanced
capitalism during certain moments of crisis. Bureaucratic property is itself
concentrated, in that the individual bureaucrat takes part in the ownership of
the entire economy only through his membership in the community of
bureaucrats. And since commodity production is less developed under
bureaucratic capitalism, it too takes on a concentrated form: the commodity
the bureaucracy appropriates is the total social labor, and what it sells back
to the society is that society’s wholesale survival. The dictatorship of the
bureaucratic economy cannot leave the exploited masses any significant margin
of choice because it has had to make all the choices itself, and any choice
made independently of it, whether regarding food or music or anything else,
thus amounts to a declaration of war against it. This dictatorship must be
enforced by permanent violence. Its spectacle imposes an image of the good
which subsumes everything that officially exists, an image which is usually
concentrated in a single individual, the guarantor of the system’s
totalitarian cohesion. Everyone must magically identify with this absolute
star or disappear. This master of everyone else’s nonconsumption is the heroic
image that disguises the absolute exploitation entailed by the system of
primitive accumulation accelerated by terror. If the entire Chinese population
has to study Mao to the point of identifying with Mao, this is because there
is *nothing else they can be*. The dominion of the concentrated spectacle is a
police state.

**65.** The diffuse spectacle is associated with commodity abundance, with the
undisturbed development of modern capitalism. Here each individual commodity
is justified in the name of the grandeur of the total commodity production, of
which the spectacle is a laudatory catalog. Irreconcilable claims jockey for
position on the stage of the affluent economy’s unified spectacle, and
different star commodities simultaneously promote conflicting social policies.
The automobile spectacle, for example, strives for a perfect traffic flow
entailing the destruction of old urban districts, while the city spectacle
needs to preserve those districts as tourist attractions. The already dubious
satisfaction alleged to be obtained from the *consumption of the whole* is
thus constantly being disappointed because the actual consumer can directly
access only a succession of fragments of this commodity heaven, fragments
which invariably lack the quality attributed to the whole.

**66.** Each individual commodity fights for itself. It avoids acknowledging
the others and strives to impose itself everywhere as if it were the only one
in existence. The spectacle is the epic poem of this struggle, a struggle that
no fall of Troy can bring to an end. The spectacle does not sing of men and
their arms, but of commodities and their passions. In this blind struggle each
commodity, by pursuing its own passion, unconsciously generates something
beyond itself: the globalization of the commodity (which also amounts to the
commodification of the globe). Thus, as a result of the *cunning of the
commodity*, while each *particular* manifestation of the commodity eventually
falls in battle, the general commodity-form continues onward toward its
absolute realization.

**67.** The satisfaction that no longer comes from *using* the commodities
produced in abundance is now sought through recognition of their value *as
commodities*. Consumers are filled with religious fervor for the sovereign
freedom of commodities whose use has become an end in itself. Waves of
enthusiasm for particular products are propagated by all the communications
media. A film sparks a fashion craze; a magazine publicizes night spots which
in turn spin off different lines of products. The proliferation of faddish
gadgets reflects the fact that as the mass of commodities becomes increasingly
absurd, absurdity itself becomes a commodity. Trinkets such as key chains
which come as free bonuses with the purchase of some luxury product, but which
end up being traded back and forth as valued collectibles in their own right,
reflect a mystical self-abandonment to commodity transcendence. Those who
collect the trinkets that have been manufactured for the sole purpose of being
collected are accumulating commodity *indulgences* — glorious tokens of the
commodity’s real presence among the faithful. Reified people proudly display
the proofs of their intimacy with the commodity. Like the old religious
fetishism, with its convulsionary raptures and miraculous cures, the fetishism
of commodities generates its own moments of fervent exaltation. All this is
useful for only one purpose: producing habitual submission.

**68.** The pseudoneeds imposed by modern consumerism cannot be opposed by any
genuine needs or desires that are not themselves also shaped by society and
its history. But commodity abundance represents a total break in the organic
development of social needs. Its mechanical accumulation unleashes an
*unlimited artificiality* which overpowers any living desire. The cumulative
power of this autonomous artificiality ends up by *falsifying all social
life*.

**69.** The image of blissful social unification through consumption merely
*postpones* the consumer’s awareness of the actual divisions until his next
disillusionment with some particular commodity. Each new product is
ceremoniously acclaimed as a unique creation offering a dramatic shortcut to
the promised land of total consummation. But as with the fashionable adoption
of seemingly aristocratic first names which end up being given to virtually
all individuals of the same age, the objects that promise uniqueness can be
offered up for mass consumption only if they have been mass-produced. The
prestigiousness of mediocre objects of this kind is solely due to the fact
that they have been placed, however briefly, at the center of social life and
hailed as a revelation of the unfathomable purposes of production. But the
object that was prestigious in the spectacle becomes mundane as soon as it is
taken home by its consumer — and by all its other consumers. Too late, it
reveals its essential poverty, a poverty that inevitably reflects the poverty
of its production. Meanwhile, some other object is already replacing it as
representative of the system and demanding its own moment of acclaim.

**70.** The fraudulence of the satisfactions offered by the system is exposed
by this continual replacement of products and of general conditions of
production. In both the diffuse and the concentrated spectacle, entities that
have brazenly asserted their definitive perfection nevertheless end up
changing, and only the system endures. Stalin, like any other outmoded
commodity, is denounced by the very forces that originally promoted him. Each
*new lie* of the advertising industry is an *admission* of its previous lie.
And with each downfall of a personification of totalitarian power, the
*illusory community* that had unanimously approved him is exposed as a mere
conglomeration of loners without illusions.

**71.** The things the spectacle presents as eternal are based on change, and
must change as their foundations change. The spectacle is totally dogmatic,
yet it is incapable of arriving at any really solid dogma. Nothing stands
still for it. This instability is the spectacle’s natural condition, but it is
completely contrary to its natural inclination.

**72.** The unreal unity proclaimed by the spectacle masks the class division
underlying the real unity of the capitalist mode of production. What obliges
the producers to participate in the construction of the world is also what
excludes them from it. What brings people into relation with each other by
liberating them from their local and national limitations is also what keeps
them apart. What requires increased rationality is also what nourishes the
irrationality of hierarchical exploitation and repression. What produces
society’s abstract power also produces its concrete *lack of freedom*.

**73.** The real movement that transforms existing conditions has been the
dominant social force since the bourgeoisie’s victory within the economic
sphere, and this dominance became visible once that victory was translated
onto the political plane. The development of productive forces shattered the
old production relations, and all static order crumbled. Everything that was
absolute became historical.

**74.** When people are thrust into history and forced to participate in the
work and struggles that constitute history, they find themselves obliged to
view their relationships in a clear and disabused manner. This history has no
object distinct from what it creates from out of itself, although the final
unconscious metaphysical vision of the historical era considered the
productive progression through which history had unfolded as itself the object
of history. As for the *subject* of history, it can be nothing other than the
self-production of the living — living people becoming masters and possessors
of their own historical world and of their own *fully conscious adventures*.

**75.** The class struggles of the long *era of revolutions* initiated by the
rise of the bourgeoisie have developed in tandem with the dialectical
*“thought of history”* — the thought which is no longer content to seek the
meaning of what exists, but which strives to comprehend the dissolution of
what exists, and in the process breaks down every separation.

**76.** For Hegel the point was no longer to interpret the world, but to
interpret the *transformation* of the world. But because he limited himself to
*merely interpreting* that transformation, Hegel only represents the
*philosophical* culmination of philosophy. He seeks to understand a world that
*develops by itself*. This historical thought is still a consciousness that
always arrives too late, a consciousness that can only formulate
*retrospective* justifications of what has already happened. It has thus gone
beyond separation *only in thought*. Hegel’s paradoxical stance — his
subordination of the meaning of all reality to its historical culmination
while at the same time proclaiming that his own system represents that
culmination — flows from the simple fact that this thinker of the bourgeois
revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sought in his
philosophy only a *reconciliation* with the results of those revolutions.
“Even as a philosophy of the bourgeois revolution, it does not express the
entire process of this revolution, but only its concluding phase. In this
sense it is a philosophy not of the revolution, but of the restoration” (Karl
Korsch, “Theses on Hegel and Revolution”). Hegel performed the task of the
philosopher — “the glorification of what exists” — for the last time; but
already what existed for him could be nothing less than the entire movement of
history. Since he nevertheless maintained the *external* position of thought,
this externality could be masked only by identifying that thought with a
preexisting project of the Spirit — of that absolute heroic force which has
done what it willed and willed what it has done, and whose ultimate goal
coincides with the present. Philosophy, in the process of being superseded by
historical thought, has thus arrived at the point where it can glorify its
world only by denying it, since in order to speak it must presuppose that the
total history to which it has relegated everything has already come to an end,
and that the only tribunal where truth could be judged is closed.

**77.** When the proletariat demonstrates through its own actions that this
historical thought has not been forgotten, its refutation of that thought’s
*conclusion* is at the same time a confirmation of its *method*.

**78.** Historical thought can be salvaged only by becoming practical thought;
and the practice of the proletariat as a revolutionary class can be nothing
less than historical consciousness operating on the totality of its world. All
the theoretical currents of the *revolutionary* working-class movement —
Stirner and Bakunin as well as Marx — grew out of a critical confrontation
with Hegelian thought.

**79.** The inseparability of Marx’s theory from the Hegelian method is itself
inseparable from that theory’s revolutionary character, that is, from its
truth. It is in this regard that the relationship between Marx and Hegel has
generally been ignored or misunderstood, or even denounced as the weak point
of what became fallaciously transformed into a *doctrine*: “Marxism.”
Bernstein implicitly revealed this connection between the dialectical method
and historical *partisanship* when in his book *Evolutionary Socialism* he
deplored the 1847 *Manifesto*’s unscientific predictions of imminent
proletarian revolution in Germany: “This historical self-deception, so
erroneous that the most naïve political visionary could hardly have done any
worse, would be incomprehensible in a Marx who at that time had already
seriously studied economics if we did not recognize that it reflected the
lingering influence of the antithetical Hegelian dialectic, from which Marx,
like Engels, could never completely free himself. In those times of general
effervescence this influence was all the more fatal to him.”

**80.** The inversion carried out by Marx in order to “salvage” the thought of
the bourgeois revolutions by transferring it to a different context does not
trivially consist of putting the materialist development of productive forces
in place of the journey of the Hegelian Spirit toward its eventual encounter
with itself — the Spirit whose objectification is identical to its alienation
and whose historical wounds leave no scars. For once history becomes real, it
no longer has an *end*. Marx demolished Hegel’s position of *detachment* from
events, as well as passive *contemplation* by any supreme external agent
whatsoever. Henceforth, theory’s concern is simply to know what it itself is
doing. In contrast, present-day society’s passive contemplation of the
movement of the economy is an *untranscended* holdover from the
*undialectical* aspect of Hegel’s attempt to create a circular system; it is
an approval that is no longer on the conceptual level and that no longer needs
a Hegelianism to justify itself, because the movement it now praises is a
sector of a world where thought no longer has any place, a sector whose
mechanical development effectively dominates everything. Marx’s project is a
project of conscious history, in which the quantitativeness that arises out of
the blind development of merely economic productive forces must be transformed
into a qualitative appropriation of history. The *critique of political
economy* is the first act of this *end of prehistory:* “Of all the instruments
of production, the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class
itself.”

**81.** Marx’s theory is closely linked with scientific thought insofar as it
seeks a rational understanding of the forces that really operate in society.
But it ultimately goes *beyond* scientific thought, preserving it only by
superseding it. It seeks to understand social *struggles*, not sociological
*laws*. “We recognize only one science: the science of history” (*The German
Ideology*).

**82.** The bourgeois era, which wants to give history a scientific
foundation, overlooks the fact that the science available to it could itself
arise only on the foundation of the historical development of the economy. But
history is fundamentally dependent on this economic knowledge only so long as
it remains merely *economic history*. The extent to which the viewpoint of
scientific observation could overlook history’s effect on the economy (an
overall process modifying its own scientific premises) is shown by the vanity
of those socialists who thought they had calculated the exact periodicity of
economic crises. Now that constant government intervention has succeeded in
counteracting the tendencies toward crisis, the same type of mentality sees
this delicate balance as a definitive economic harmony. The project of
transcending the economy and mastering history must grasp and incorporate the
science of society, but it cannot itself be a *scientific* project. The
revolutionary movement remains *bourgeois* insofar as it thinks it can master
current history by means of scientific knowledge.

**83.** The utopian currents of socialism, though they are historically
grounded in criticism of the existing social system, can rightly be called
utopian insofar as they ignore history (that is, insofar as they ignore actual
struggles taking place and any passage of time outside the immutable
perfection of their image of a happy society), but not because they reject
science. On the contrary, the utopian thinkers were completely dominated by
the scientific thought of earlier centuries. They sought the completion and
fulfillment of that general rational system. They did not consider themselves
unarmed prophets, for they firmly believed in the social power of scientific
proof and even, in the case of Saint-Simonism, in the seizure of power by
science. “Why,” Sombart asked, “would they want to seize through struggle what
merely needed to be *proved*?” But the utopians’ scientific understanding did
not include the awareness that some social groups have vested interests in
maintaining the status quo, forces to maintain it, and forms of false
consciousness to reinforce it. Their grasp of reality thus lagged far behind
the historical reality of the development of science itself, which had been
largely oriented by the *social requirements* arising from such factors, which
determined not only what findings were considered acceptable, but even what
might or might not become an object of scientific research. The utopian
socialists remained prisoners of the *scientific manner of expounding the
truth*, viewing this truth as a pure abstract image — the form in which it had
established itself at a much earlier stage of social development. As Sorel
noted, the utopians took *astronomy* as their model for discovering and
demonstrating the laws of society; their unhistorical conception of harmony
was the natural result of their attempt to apply to society the science least
dependent on history. They described this harmony as if they were Newtons
discovering universal scientific laws, and the happy ending they constantly
evoked “plays a role in their social science analogous to the role of inertia
in classical physics” (*Materials for a Theory of the Proletariat*).

**84.** The scientific-determinist aspect of Marx’s thought was precisely what
made it vulnerable to “ideologization,” both during his own lifetime and even
more so in the theoretical heritage he left to the workers movement. The
advent of the historical subject continues to be postponed, and it is
economics, the historical science *par excellence*, which is increasingly seen
as guaranteeing the inevitability of its own future negation. In this way
*revolutionary practice*, the only true agent of this negation, tends to be
pushed out of theory’s field of vision. Instead, it is seen as essential to
patiently study economic development, and to go back to accepting the
suffering which that development imposes with a Hegelian tranquility. The
result remains “a graveyard of good intentions.” The “science of revolutions”
then concludes that *consciousness always comes too soon*, and has to be
taught. “History has shown that we, and all who thought as we did, were
wrong,” Engels wrote in 1895. “It has made clear that the state of economic
development on the Continent at that time was far from being ripe.” Throughout
his life Marx had maintained a unitary point of view in his theory, but the
*exposition* of his theory was carried out on the *terrain* of the dominant
thought insofar as it took the form of critiques of particular disciplines,
most notably the critique of that fundamental science of bourgeois society,
political economy. It was in this mutilated form, which eventually came to be
seen as orthodox, that Marx’s theory was transformed into “Marxism.”

**85.** The weakness of Marx’s theory is naturally linked to the weakness of
the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat of his time. The German working
class failed to inaugurate a permanent revolution in 1848; the Paris Commune
was defeated in isolation. As a result, revolutionary theory could not yet be
fully realized. The fact that Marx was reduced to defending and refining it by
cloistered scholarly work in the British Museum had a debilitating effect on
the theory itself. His scientific conclusions about the future development of
the working class, and the organizational practice apparently implied by those
conclusions, became obstacles to proletarian consciousness at a later stage.

**86.** The theoretical shortcomings of the *scientific* defense of
proletarian revolution (both in its content and in its form of exposition) all
ultimately result from identifying the proletariat with the bourgeoisie *with
respect to the revolutionary seizure of power*.

**87.** As early as the *Communist Manifesto*, Marx’s effort to demonstrate
the legitimacy of proletarian power by citing a *repetitive* sequence of
precedents led him to oversimplify his historical analysis into a *linear*
model of the development of modes of production, in which class struggles
invariably resulted “either in a revolutionary transformation of the entire
society or in the mutual ruin of the contending classes.” The plain facts of
history, however, are that the “Asiatic mode of production” (as Marx himself
acknowledged elsewhere) maintained its immobility despite all its class
conflicts; that no serf uprising ever overthrew the feudal lords; and that
none of the slave revolts in the ancient world ended the rule of the freemen.
The linear schema loses sight of the fact that *the bourgeoisie is the only
revolutionary class that has ever won;* and that it is also the only class for
which the development of the economy was both the cause and the consequence of
its taking control of society. The same oversimplification led Marx to neglect
the economic role of the state in the management of class society. If the
rising bourgeoisie seemed to liberate the economy from the state, this was
true only to the extent that the previous state was an instrument of class
oppression within a *static economy*. The bourgeoisie originally developed its
independent economic power during the medieval period when the state had been
weakened and feudalism was breaking up the stable equilibrium between
different powers. In contrast, the modern state — which began to support the
bourgeoisie’s development through its mercantile policies and which developed
into *the bourgeoisie’s own state* during the *laissez-faire* era — was
eventually to emerge as a central power in the planned management of the
*economic process*. Marx was nevertheless able to describe the “Bonapartist”
prototype of modern statist bureaucracy, the fusion of capital and state to
create a “national power of capital over labor, a public force designed to
maintain social servitude” — a form of social order in which the bourgeoisie
renounces all historical life apart from what has been reduced to the economic
history of *things*, and would like to be “condemned to the same political
nothingness as all the other classes.” The sociopolitical foundations of the
modern spectacle are already discernable here, and these foundations
negatively imply that the proletariat is *the only pretender to historical
life*.

**88.** The only two classes that really correspond to Marx’s theory, the two
pure classes that the entire analysis of *Capital* brings to the fore, are the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat. These are also the only two revolutionary
classes in history, but operating under very different conditions. The
bourgeois revolution is done. The proletarian revolution is a yet-unrealized
project, born on the foundation of the earlier revolution but differing from
it qualitatively. If one overlooks the *originality* of the historical role of
the bourgeoisie, one also tends to overlook the specific originality of the
proletarian project, which can achieve nothing unless it carries its own
banners and recognizes the “immensity of its own tasks.” The bourgeoisie came
to power because it was the class of the developing economy. The proletariat
cannot create its own new form of power except by becoming the *class of
consciousness*. The growth of productive forces will not in itself guarantee
the emergence of such a power — not even indirectly by way of the increasing
dispossession which that growth entails. Nor can a Jacobin-style seizure of
the state be a means to this end. The proletariat cannot make use of any
*ideology* designed to disguise its partial goals as general goals, because
the proletariat cannot preserve any partial reality that is truly its own.

**89.** If Marx, during a certain period of his participation in the
proletarian struggle, placed too great a reliance on scientific prediction, to
the point of creating the intellectual basis for the illusions of economism,
it is clear that he himself did not succumb to those illusions. In a
well-known letter of 7 December 1867, accompanying an article criticizing
*Capital* which he himself had written but which he wanted Engels to present
to the press as the work of an adversary, Marx clearly indicated the limits of
his own science: “The author’s *subjective* tendency (imposed on him, perhaps,
by his political position and his past), namely the manner in which he views
and presents the final outcome of the present movement and social process, has
no connection with his actual analysis.” By thus disparaging the “tendentious
conclusions” of his own objective analysis, and by the irony of the “perhaps”
with reference to the extrascientific choices supposedly “imposed” on him,
Marx implicitly revealed the methodological key to fusing the two aspects.

**90.** The fusion of knowledge and action must be effected within the
historical struggle itself, in such a way that each depends on the other for
its validation. The proletarian class is formed into a subject in its process
of organizing revolutionary struggles and in its reorganization of society at
the *moment of revolution* — this is where the *practical conditions of
consciousness* must exist, conditions in which the theory of praxis is
confirmed by becoming practical theory. But this crucial question of
organization was virtually ignored by revolutionary theory during the period
when the workers movement was first taking shape — the very period when that
theory still possessed the *unitary* character it had inherited from
historical thought (and which it had rightly vowed to develop into a unitary
historical *practice*). Instead, the organizational question became the
weakest aspect of radical theory, a confused terrain lending itself to the
revival of hierarchical and statist tactics borrowed from the bourgeois
revolution. The forms of organization of the workers movement that were
developed on the basis of this theoretical negligence tended in turn to
inhibit the maintenance of a unitary theory by breaking it up into various
specialized and fragmented disciplines. This ideologically alienated theory
was then no longer able to recognize the practical verifications of the
unitary historical thought it had betrayed when such verifications emerged in
spontaneous working-class struggles; instead, it contributed toward repressing
every manifestation and memory of them. Yet those historical forms that took
shape in struggle were precisely the practical terrain that was needed in
order to validate the theory. They were what the theory needed, yet that need
had not been formulated theoretically. The *soviet*, for example, was not a
theoretical discovery. And the most advanced theoretical truth of the
International Workingmen’s Association was its own existence in practice.

**91.** The First International’s initial successes enabled it to free itself
from the confused influences of the dominant ideology that had survived within
it. But the defeat and repression that it soon encountered brought to the
surface a conflict between two different conceptions of proletarian
revolution, each of which contained an *authoritarian* aspect that amounted to
abandoning the conscious self-emancipation of the working class. The feud
between the Marxists and the Bakuninists, which eventually became
irreconcilable, actually centered on two different issues — the question of
power in a future revolutionary society and the question of the organization
of the current movement — and each of the adversaries reversed their position
when they went from one aspect to the other. Bakunin denounced the illusion
that classes could be abolished by means of an authoritarian implementation of
state power, warning that this would lead to the formation of a new
bureaucratic ruling class and to the dictatorship of the most knowledgeable
(or of those reputed to be such). Marx, who believed that the concomitant
maturation of economic contradictions and of the workers’ education in
democracy would reduce the role of a proletarian state to a brief phase needed
to legitimize the new social relations brought into being by objective
factors, denounced Bakunin and his supporters as an authoritarian
conspiratorial elite who were deliberately placing themselves above the
International with the harebrained scheme of imposing on society an
irresponsible dictatorship of the most revolutionary (or of those who would
designate themselves as such). Bakunin did in fact recruit followers on such a
basis: “In the midst of the popular tempest we must be the invisible pilots
guiding the revolution, not through any kind of overt power but through the
collective dictatorship of our Alliance — a dictatorship without any badges or
titles or official status, yet all the more powerful because it will have none
of the appearances of power.” Thus two *ideologies* of working-class
revolution opposed each other, each containing a partially true critique, but
each losing the unity of historical thought and setting itself up as an
ideological *authority*. Powerful organizations such as German Social
Democracy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation faithfully served one or the
other of these ideologies; and everywhere the result was very different from
what had been sought.

**92.** The fact that anarchists have seen the goal of proletarian revolution
as *immediately present* represents both the strength and the weakness of
collectivist anarchist struggles (the only forms of anarchism that can be
taken seriously — the pretensions of the individualist forms of anarchism have
always been ludicrous). From the historical thought of modern class struggles
collectivist anarchism retains only the conclusion, and its constant harping
on this conclusion is accompanied by a deliberate indifference to any
consideration of methods. Its critique of *political struggle* has thus
remained abstract, while its commitment to economic struggle has been
channeled toward the mirage of a definitive solution that will supposedly be
achieved by a single blow on this terrain, on the day of the general strike or
the insurrection. The anarchists have saddled themselves with *fulfilling an
ideal*. Anarchism remains a *merely ideological* negation of the state and of
class society — the very social conditions which in their turn foster separate
ideologies. It is the *ideology of pure freedom*, an ideology that puts
everything on the same level and loses any conception of the “historical evil”
(the negation at work within history). This fusion of all partial demands into
a single all-encompassing demand has given anarchism the merit of representing
the rejection of existing conditions in the name of the whole of life rather
than from the standpoint of some particular critical specialization; but the
fact that this fusion has been envisaged only in the absolute, in accordance
with individual whim and in advance of any practical actualization, has doomed
anarchism to an all too obvious incoherence. Anarchism responds to each
particular struggle by repeating and reapplying the same simple and
all-embracing lesson, because this lesson has from the beginning been
considered the be-all and end-all of the movement. This is reflected in
Bakunin’s 1873 letter of resignation from the Jura Federation: “During the
past nine years the International has developed more than enough ideas to save
the world, if ideas alone could save it, and I challenge anyone to come up
with a new one. It’s no longer the time for ideas, it’s time for actions.”
This perspective undoubtedly retains proletarian historical thought’s
recognition that ideas must be put into practice, but it abandons the
historical terrain by assuming that the appropriate forms for this transition
to practice have already been discovered and will never change.

**93.** The anarchists, who explicitly distinguish themselves from the rest of
the workers movement by their ideological conviction, reproduce this
separation of competencies within their own ranks by providing a terrain that
facilitates the informal domination of each particular anarchist organization
by propagandists and defenders of their ideology, specialists whose mediocre
intellectual activity is largely limited to the constant regurgitation of a
few eternal truths. The anarchists’ ideological reverence for unanimous
decisionmaking has ended up paving the way for uncontrolled manipulation of
their own organizations by *specialists in freedom**;* and revolutionary
anarchism expects the same type of unanimity, obtained by the same means, from
the masses once they have been liberated. Furthermore, the anarchists’ refusal
to take into account the great differences between the conditions of a
minority banded together in present-day struggles and of a postrevolutionary
society of free individuals has repeatedly led to the isolation of anarchists
when the moment for collective decisionmaking actually arrives, as is shown by
the countless anarchist insurrections in Spain that were contained and crushed
at a local level.

**94.** The illusion more or less explicitly maintained by genuine anarchism
is its constant belief that a revolution is just around the corner, and that
the instantaneous accomplishment of this revolution will demonstrate the truth
of anarchist ideology and of the form of practical organization that has
developed in accordance with that ideology. In 1936 anarchism did indeed
initiate a social revolution, a revolution that was the most advanced
expression of proletarian power ever realized. But even in that case it should
be noted that the general uprising began as a merely defensive reaction to the
army’s attempted coup. Furthermore, inasmuch as the revolution was not carried
to completion during its opening days (because Franco controlled half the
country and was being strongly supported from abroad, because the rest of the
international proletarian movement had already been defeated, and because the
anti-Franco camp included various bourgeois forces and statist working-class
parties), the organized anarchist movement proved incapable of extending the
revolution’s partial victories, or even of defending them. Its recognized
leaders became government ministers, hostages to a bourgeois state that was
destroying the revolution even as it proceeded to lose the civil war.

**95.** The “orthodox Marxism” of the Second International is the scientific
ideology of socialist revolution, an ideology which identifies its whole truth
with objective economic processes and with the progressive recognition of the
inevitability of those processes by a working class educated by the
organization. This ideology revives the faith in pedagogical demonstration
that was found among the utopian socialists, combining that faith with a
*contemplative* invocation of the course of history; but it has lost both the
Hegelian dimension of total history and the static image of totality presented
by the utopians (most richly by Fourier). This type of scientific attitude,
which can do nothing more than resurrect the traditional dilemmas between
symmetrical ethical choices, is at the root of Hilferding’s absurd conclusion
that recognizing the inevitability of socialism “gives no indication as to
what practical attitude should be adopted. For it is one thing to recognize
that something is inevitable, and quite another to put oneself in the service
of that inevitability” (*Finanzkapital*). Those who failed to realize that for
Marx and for the revolutionary proletariat unitary historical thought was *in
no way distinct from a practical attitude to be adopted* generally ended up
becoming victims of the practice they did adopt.

**96.** The ideology of the social-democratic organizations put those
organizations under the control of the *professors* who were educating the
working class, and their organizational forms corresponded to this type of
passive apprenticeship. The participation of the socialists of the Second
International in political and economic struggles was admittedly concrete, but
it was profoundly *uncritical*. It was a manifestly *reformist* practice
carried on in the name of an *illusory revolutionism*. This ideology of
revolution inevitably foundered on the very successes of those who proclaimed
it. The elevation of socialist journalists and parliamentary representatives
above the rest of the movement encouraged them to become habituated to a
bourgeois lifestyle (most of them had in any case been recruited from the
bourgeois intelligentsia). And even industrial workers who had been recruited
out of struggles in the factories were transformed by the trade-union
bureaucracy into brokers of labor-power, whose task was to make sure that that
commodity was sold at a “fair” price. For the activity of all these people to
have retained any appearance of being revolutionary, capitalism would have had
to have turned out to be conveniently incapable of tolerating this economic
reformism, despite the fact that it had no trouble tolerating the legalistic
political expressions of the same reformism. The social democrats’ scientific
ideology confidently affirmed that capitalism could *not* tolerate these
economic antagonisms; but history repeatedly proved them wrong.

**97.** Bernstein, the social democrat least attached to political ideology
and most openly attached to the methodology of bourgeois science, was honest
enough to point out this contradiction (a contradiction which had also been
implied by the reformist movement of the English workers, who never bothered
to invoke any revolutionary ideology). But it was historical development
itself which ultimately provided the definitive demonstration. Although full
of illusions in other regards, Bernstein had denied that a crisis of
capitalist production would miraculously force the hand of the socialists, who
wanted to inherit the revolution only by way of this orthodox sequence of
events. The profound social upheaval touched off by World War I, though it led
to a widespread awakening of radical consciousness, twice demonstrated that
the social-democratic hierarchy had failed to provide the German workers with
a revolutionary education capable of *turning them into theorists:* first,
when the overwhelming majority of the party rallied to the imperialist war;
then, following the German defeat, when the party crushed the Spartakist
revolutionaries. The ex-worker Ebert, who had become one of the
social-democratic leaders, apparently still believed in sin since he admitted
that he hated revolution “like sin.” And he proved himself a fitting precursor
of the *socialist representation* that was soon to emerge as the mortal enemy
of the proletariat in Russia and elsewhere, when he accurately summed up the
essence of this new form of alienation: “Socialism means working a lot.”

**98.** As a Marxist thinker, Lenin was simply a faithful and consistent
*Kautskyist* who applied the *revolutionary ideology* of “orthodox Marxism”
within the conditions existing in Russia, conditions which did not lend
themselves to the reformist practice carried on elsewhere by the Second
International. In the Russian context, the Bolshevik practice of directing the
proletariat from outside, by means of a disciplined underground party under
the control of intellectuals who had become “professional revolutionaries,”
became a new profession — a profession which refused to come to terms with any
of the professional ruling strata of capitalist society (the Czarist political
regime was in any case incapable of offering any opportunities for such
compromise, which depends on an advanced stage of bourgeois power). As a
result of this intransigence, the Bolsheviks ended up becoming the sole
practitioners of the *profession of totalitarian social domination*.

**99.** With the war and the collapse of international social democracy in the
face of that war, the authoritarian ideological radicalism of the Bolsheviks
was able to spread its influence all over the world. The bloody end of the
democratic illusions of the workers movement transformed the entire world into
a Russia, and Bolshevism, reigning over the first revolutionary breakthrough
engendered by this period of crisis, offered its hierarchical and ideological
model to the proletariat of all countries, urging them to adopt it in order to
“speak Russian” to their own ruling classes. Lenin did not reproach the
Marxism of the Second International for being a revolutionary *ideology*, but
for ceasing to be a *revolutionary* ideology.

**100.** The historical moment when Bolshevism triumphed *for itself* in
Russia and social democracy fought victoriously *for the old world* marks the
inauguration of the state of affairs that is at the heart of the modern
spectacle’s domination: the *representation of the working class* has become
an *enemy* of the working class.

**101.** “In all previous revolutions,” wrote Rosa Luxemburg in *Die Rote
Fahne* of 21 December 1918, “the combatants faced each other openly and
directly — class against class, program against program. In the present
revolution, the troops protecting the old order are not fighting under the
insignia of the ruling class, but under the banner of a ‘social-democratic
party.’ If the central question of revolution was posed openly and honestly —
Capitalism or socialism? — the great mass of the proletariat would today have
no doubts or hesitations.” Thus, a few days before its destruction, the
radical current of the German proletariat discovered the secret of the new
conditions engendered by the whole process that had gone before (a development
to which the representation of the working class had greatly contributed): the
spectacular organization of the ruling order’s defense, the social reign of
appearances where no “central question” can any longer be posed “openly and
honestly.” The revolutionary representation of the proletariat had at this
stage become both the primary cause and the central result of the general
falsification of society.

**102.** The organization of the proletariat in accordance with the Bolshevik
model resulted from the backwardness of Russia and from the abandonment of
revolutionary struggle by the workers movements of the advanced countries.
These same backward conditions also tended to foster the counterrevolutionary
aspects which that form of organization had unconsciously contained from its
inception. The repeated failure of the mass of the European workers movement
to take advantage of the golden opportunities of the 1918-1920 period (a
failure which included the violent destruction of its own radical minority)
favored the consolidation of the Bolshevik development and enabled that
fraudulent outcome to present itself to the world as the only possible
proletarian solution. By seizing a state monopoly as sole representative and
defender of working-class power, the Bolshevik Party justified itself and
*became what it already was:* the party of the *owners of the proletariat*,
owners who essentially eliminated earlier forms of property.

**103.** For twenty years the various tendencies of Russian social democracy
had engaged in an unresolved debate over all the conditions that might bear on
the overthrow of Czarism — the weakness of the bourgeoisie; the preponderance
of the peasant majority; and the potentially decisive role of a proletariat
which was concentrated and combative but which constituted only a small
minority of the population. This debate was eventually resolved in practice by
a factor that had not figured in any of the hypotheses: a revolutionary
bureaucracy that placed itself at the head of the proletariat, seized state
power and proceeded to impose a new form of class domination. A strictly
bourgeois revolution had been impossible; talk of a “democratic dictatorship
of workers and peasants” was meaningless verbiage; and the proletarian power
of the soviets could not simultaneously maintain itself against the class of
small landowners, against the national and international White reaction, and
against its own representation which had become externalized and alienated in
the form of a working-class party that maintained total control over the
state, the economy, the means of expression, and soon even over people’s
thoughts. Trotsky’s and Parvus’s theory of permanent revolution, which Lenin
adopted in April 1917, was the only theory that proved true for countries with
underdeveloped bourgeoisies; but it became true only after the unknown factor
of bureaucratic class power came into the picture. In the numerous arguments
within the Bolshevik leadership, Lenin was the most consistent advocate of
concentrating dictatorial power in the hands of this supreme ideological
representation. Lenin was right every time in the sense that he invariably
supported the solution implied by earlier choices of the minority that now
exercised absolute power: the democracy that was kept from peasants by means
of the *state* would have to be kept from workers as well, which led to
denying it to Communist union leaders and to party members in general, and
finally to the highest ranks of the party hierarchy. At the Tenth Congress, as
the Kronstadt soviet was being crushed by arms and buried under a barrage of
slander, Lenin attacked the radical-left bureaucrats who had formed a
“Workers’ Opposition” faction with the following ultimatum, the logic of which
Stalin would later extend to an absolute division of the world: “You can stand
here with us, or against us out there with a gun in your hand, but not within
some opposition…. We’ve had enough opposition.”

**104.** After Kronstadt, the bureaucracy consolidated its power as sole owner
of a system of *state capitalism* — internally by means of a temporary
alliance with the peasantry (the “New Economic Policy”) and externally by
using the workers regimented into the bureaucratic parties of the Third
International as a backup force for Russian diplomacy, sabotaging the entire
revolutionary movement and supporting bourgeois governments whose support it
in turn hoped to secure in the sphere of international politics (the
Kuomintang regime in the China of 1925-27, the Popular Fronts in Spain and
France, etc.). The Russian bureaucracy then carried this consolidation of
power to the next stage by subjecting the peasantry to a reign of terror,
implementing the most brutal primitive accumulation of capital in history. The
industrialization of the Stalin era revealed the *bureaucracy’s* ultimate
function: continuing the reign of the economy by preserving the essence of
market society: commodified labor. It also demonstrated the independence of
the economy: the economy has come to dominate society so completely that it
has proved capable of recreating the class domination it needs for its own
continued operation; that is, the bourgeoisie has created an independent power
that is capable of maintaining itself even without a bourgeoisie. The
totalitarian bureaucracy was not “the last owning class in history” in Bruno
Rizzi’s sense; it was merely a *substitute ruling class* for the commodity
economy. An impotent capitalist property system was replaced by a cruder
version of itself — simplified, less diversified, and *concentrated* as the
collective property of the bureaucratic class. This underdeveloped type of
ruling class is also a reflection of economic underdevelopment, and it has no
agenda beyond overcoming this underdevelopment in certain regions of the
world. The hierarchical and statist framework for this crude remake of the
capitalist ruling class was provided by the working-class party, which was
itself modeled on the hierarchical separations of bourgeois organizations. As
Ante Ciliga noted while in one of Stalin’s prisons, “Technical questions of
organization turned out to be social questions” (*Lenin and the Revolution*).

**105.** Leninism was the highest voluntaristic expression of revolutionary
ideology — a *coherence of the separate* governing a reality that resisted it.
With the advent of Stalinism, revolutionary ideology *returned to its
fundamental incoherence*. At that point, ideology was no longer a weapon, it
had become an end in itself. But a lie that can no longer be challenged
becomes insane. The totalitarian ideological pronouncement obliterates reality
as well as purpose; nothing exists but what it says exists. Although this
crude form of the spectacle has been confined to certain underdeveloped
regions, it has nevertheless played an essential role in the spectacle’s
global development. This particular materialization of ideology did not
transform the world economically, as did advanced capitalism; it simply used
police-state methods to transform people’s *perception* of the world.

**106.** The ruling totalitarian-ideological class is the ruler of a world
turned upside down. The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to
exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim. It is modest
only on this one point, however, because this officially nonexistent
bureaucracy simultaneously attributes the crowning achievements of history to
its own infallible leadership. Though its existence is everywhere in evidence,
the bureaucracy must be *invisible as a class*. As a result, all social life
becomes insane. The social organization of total falsehood stems from this
fundamental contradiction.

**107.** Stalinism was also a reign of terror *within* the bureaucratic class.
The terrorism on which this class’s power was based inevitably came to strike
the class itself, because this class has no juridical legitimacy, no legally
recognized status as an owning class which could be extended to each of its
members. Its ownership has to be masked because it is based on false
consciousness. This false consciousness can maintain its total power only by
means of a total reign of terror in which all real motives are ultimately
obscured. The members of the ruling bureaucratic class have the right of
ownership over society only collectively, as participants in a fundamental
lie: they have to play the role of the proletariat governing a socialist
society; they have to be actors faithful to a script of ideological betrayal.
Yet they cannot actually participate in this counterfeit entity unless their
legitimacy is validated. No bureaucrat can individually assert his right to
power, because to prove himself a socialist proletarian he would have to
demonstrate that he was the opposite of a bureaucrat, while to prove himself a
bureaucrat is impossible because the bureaucracy’s official line is that there
is no bureaucracy. Each bureaucrat is thus totally dependent on the *central
seal of legitimacy* provided by the ruling ideology, which validates the
collective participation in its “socialist regime” of *all the bureaucrats it
does not liquidate*. Although the bureaucrats are collectively empowered to
make all social decisions, the cohesion of their own class can be ensured only
by the concentration of their terrorist power in a single person. In this
person resides the only practical truth of the *ruling lie:* the power to
determine an unchallengeable boundary line which is nevertheless constantly
being adjusted. Stalin decides without appeal who is and who is not a member
of the ruling bureaucracy — who should be considered a “proletarian in power”
and who branded “a traitor in the pay of Wall Street and the Mikado.” The
atomized bureaucrats can find their collective legitimacy only in the person
of Stalin — the lord of the world who thus comes to see himself as the
absolute person, for whom no superior spirit exists. “The lord of the world
recognizes his own nature — omnipresent power — through the destructive
violence he exerts against the contrastingly powerless selfhood of his
subjects.” He is the power that defines the terrain of domination, and he is
also “the power that *ravages* that terrain.”

**108.** When ideology has become total through its possession of total power,
and has changed from partial truth to totalitarian falsehood, historical
thought has been so totally annihilated that history itself, even at the level
of the most empirical knowledge, can no longer exist. Totalitarian
bureaucratic society lives in a perpetual present in which whatever has
previously happened is determined solely by its police. The project already
envisioned by Napoleon of “monarchically controlling memory” has been realized
in Stalinism’s constant rewriting of the past, which alters not only the
interpretations of past events but even the events themselves. But the price
paid for this liberation from all historical reality is the loss of the
rational frame of reference that is indispensable to capitalism as a
*historical* social system. The Lysenko fiasco is just one well-known example
of how much the scientific application of ideology gone mad has cost the
Russian economy. This contradiction — the fact that a totalitarian bureaucracy
trying to administer an industrialized society is caught between its need for
rationality and its repression of rationality — is also one of its main
weaknesses in comparison with normal capitalist development. Just as the
bureaucracy cannot resolve the question of agriculture as ordinary capitalism
has done, it also proves inferior to the latter in the field of industrial
production, because its unrealistic authoritarian planning is based on
omnipresent falsifications.

**109.** Between the two world wars the revolutionary working-class movement
was destroyed by the joint action of the Stalinist bureaucracy and of fascist
totalitarianism (the latter’s organizational form having been inspired by the
totalitarian party that had first been tested and developed in Russia).
Fascism was a desperate attempt to defend the bourgeois economy from the dual
threat of crisis and proletarian subversion, a *state of siege* in which
capitalist society saved itself by giving itself an emergency dose of
rationalization in the form of massive state intervention. But this
rationalization is hampered by the extreme irrationality of its methods.
Although fascism rallies to the defense of the main icons of a bourgeois
ideology that has become conservative (family, private property, moral order,
patriotism), while mobilizing the petty bourgeoisie and the unemployed workers
who are panic-stricken by economic crisis or disillusioned by the socialist
movement’s failure to bring about a revolution, it is not itself fundamentally
ideological. It presents itself as what it is — a violent resurrection of
*myth* calling for participation in a community defined by archaic
pseudovalues: race, blood, leader. Fascism is a *technologically equipped
primitivism*. Its factitious mythological rehashes are presented in the
spectacular context of the most modern means of conditioning and illusion. It
is thus a significant factor in the formation of the modern spectacle, and its
role in the destruction of the old working-class movement also makes it one of
the founding forces of present-day society. But since it is also the most
*costly* method of preserving the capitalist order, it has generally ended up
being replaced by the major capitalist states, which represent stronger and
more rational forms of that order.

**110.** When the Russian bureaucracy has finally succeeded in doing away with
the vestiges of bourgeois property that hampered its rule over the economy,
and in developing this economy for its own purposes, and in being recognized
as a member of the club of great powers, it wants to enjoy its world in peace
and to disencumber itself from the arbitrariness to which it is still
subjected. It thus denounces the Stalinism at its origin. But this
denunciation remains Stalinist — arbitrary, unexplained, and subject to
continual modification — because *the ideological lie at its origin can never
be revealed*. The bureaucracy cannot liberalize itself either culturally or
politically because its existence as a class depends on its ideological
monopoly, which, for all its cumbersomeness, is its sole title to power. This
ideology has lost the passion of its original expression, but its passionless
routinization still has the repressive function of controlling all thought and
prohibiting any competition whatsoever. The bureaucracy is thus helplessly
tied to an ideology that is no longer believed by anyone. The power that used
to inspire terror now inspires ridicule, but this ridiculed power still
defends itself with the threat of resorting to the terrorizing force it would
like to be rid of. Thus, at the very time when the bureaucracy hopes to
demonstrate its superiority on the terrain of capitalism it reveals itself to
be a *poor cousin* of capitalism. Just as its actual history contradicts its
façade of legality and its crudely maintained ignorance contradicts its
scientific pretensions, so its attempt to vie with the bourgeoisie in the
production of commodity abundance is stymied by the fact that such abundance
contains *its own implicit ideology*, and is generally accompanied by the
freedom to choose from an unlimited range of spectacular pseudoalternatives —
a pseudofreedom that remains incompatible with the bureaucracy’s ideology.

**111.** The bureaucracy’s ideological title to power is already collapsing at
the international level. The power that established itself nationally in the
name of an ostensibly internationalist perspective is now forced to recognize
that it can no longer impose its system of lies beyond its own national
borders. The unequal economic development of diverse bureaucracies with
competing interests that have succeeded in establishing their own “socialism”
in more than one country has led to an all-out public confrontation between
the Russian lie and the Chinese lie. From this point on, each bureaucracy in
power will have to find its own way; and the same is true for each of the
totalitarian parties aspiring to such power (notably those that still survive
from the Stalinist period among certain national working classes). This
international collapse has been further aggravated by the expressions of
internal negation which first became visible to the outside world when the
workers of East Berlin revolted against the bureaucrats and demanded a
“government of steel workers” — a negation which has in one case already gone
to the point of sovereign workers councils in Hungary. But in the final
analysis, this crumbling of the global alliance of pseudosocialist
bureaucracies is also a most unfavorable development for the future of
capitalist society. The bourgeoisie is in the process of losing the adversary
that objectively supported it by providing an illusory unification of all
opposition to the existing order. This division of labor between two mutually
reinforcing forms of the spectacle comes to an end when the
pseudorevolutionary role in turn divides. The spectacular component of the
destruction of the working-class movement is itself headed for destruction.

**112.** The only current partisans of the Leninist illusion are the various
Trotskyist tendencies, which stubbornly persist in identifying the proletarian
project with an ideologically based hierarchical organization despite all the
historical experiences that have refuted that perspective. The distance that
separates Trotskyism from a revolutionary critique of present-day society is
related to the deferential distance the Trotskyists maintain regarding
positions that were already mistaken when they were acted on in real
struggles. Trotsky remained fundamentally loyal to the upper bureaucracy until
1927, while striving to gain control of it so as to make it resume a genuinely
Bolshevik foreign policy. (It is well known, for example, that in order to
help conceal Lenin’s famous “Testament” he went so far as to slanderously
disavow his own supporter Max Eastman, who had made it public.) Trotsky was
doomed by his basic perspective, because once the bureaucracy became aware
that it had evolved into a counterrevolutionary class on the domestic front,
it was bound to opt for a *similarly counterrevolutionary role* in other
countries (though still, of course, in the name of revolution). Trotsky’s
subsequent efforts to create a Fourth International reflect the same
inconsistency. Once he had become an unconditional partisan of the Bolshevik
form of organization (which he did during the second Russian revolution), he
refused for the rest of his life to recognize that the bureaucracy was a new
ruling class. When Lukács, in 1923, presented this same organizational form as
the long-sought link between theory and practice, in which proletarians cease
being mere “spectators” of the events that occur in their organization and
begin consciously choosing and experiencing those events, he was describing as
merits of the Bolshevik Party everything that that party was *not*. Despite
his profound theoretical work, Lukács remained an ideologue, speaking in the
name of the power that was most grossly alien to the proletarian movement, yet
believing and pretending that he found himself *completely at home with it*.
As subsequent events demonstrated how that power disavows and suppresses its
lackeys, Lukács’s endless self-repudiations revealed with caricatural clarity
that he had identified with the *total opposite* of himself and of everything
he had argued for in *History and Class Consciousness*. No one better than
Lukács illustrates the validity of the fundamental rule for assessing all the
intellectuals of this century: What they *respect* is a precise gauge of their
own *degradation*. Yet Lenin had hardly encouraged these sorts of illusions
about his activities. On the contrary, he acknowledged that “a political party
cannot examine its members to see if there are contradictions between their
philosophy and the party program.” The party whose idealized portrait Lukács
had so inopportunely drawn was in reality suited for only one very specific
and limited task: the seizure of state power.

**113.** Since the neo-Leninist illusion carried on by present-day Trotskyism
is constantly being contradicted by the reality of modern capitalist societies
(both bourgeois and bureaucratic), it is not surprising that it gets its most
favorable reception in the nominally independent “underdeveloped” countries,
where the local ruling classes’ versions of bureaucratic state socialism end
up amounting to little more than a mere *ideology of economic development*.
The hybrid composition of these ruling classes tends to correspond to their
position within the bourgeois-bureaucratic spectrum. Their international
maneuvering between those two poles of capitalist power, along with their
numerous ideological compromises (notably with Islam) stemming from their
heterogeneous social bases, end up removing from these degraded versions of
ideological socialism everything serious except the police. One type of
bureaucracy establishes itself by forging an organization capable of combining
national struggle with agrarian peasant revolt; it then, as in China, tends to
apply the Stalinist model of industrialization in societies that are even less
developed than Russia was in 1917. A bureaucracy able to industrialize the
nation may also develop out of the petty bourgeoisie, with power being seized
by army officers, as happened in Egypt. In other situations, such as the
aftermath of the Algerian war of independence, a bureaucracy that has
established itself as a para-state authority in the course of struggle may
seek a stabilizing compromise by merging with a weak national bourgeoisie.
Finally, in the former colonies of black Africa that remain openly tied to the
American and European bourgeoisie, a local bourgeoisie constitutes itself
(usually based on the power of traditional tribal chiefs) *through its
possession of the state*. Foreign imperialism remains the real master of the
economy of these countries, but at a certain stage its native agents are
rewarded for their sale of local products by being granted possession of a
local state — a state that is independent from the local masses but not from
imperialism. Incapable of accumulating capital, this artificial bourgeoisie
does nothing but *squander* the surplus value it extracts from local labor and
the subsidies it receives from protector states and international monopolies.
Because of the obvious inability of these bourgeois classes to fulfill the
normal economic functions of a bourgeoisie, they soon find themselves
challenged by oppositional movements based on the bureaucratic model (more or
less adapted to particular local conditions). But if such bureaucracies
succeed in their fundamental project of industrialization, they produce the
historical conditions for their own defeat: by accumulating capital they also
accumulate a proletariat, thus creating their own negation in countries where
that negation had not previously existed.

**114.** In the course of this complex and terrible evolution which has
brought the era of class struggles to a new set of conditions, the proletariat
of the industrial countries has lost its ability to assert its own independent
perspective. In a fundamental sense, it has also lost *its illusions*. But it
has not lost its being. The proletariat has not been eliminated. It remains
irreducibly present within the intensified alienation of modern capitalism. It
consists of that vast majority of workers who have lost all power over their
lives and who, *once they become aware of this*, redefine themselves as the
proletariat, the force working to negate this society from within. This
proletariat is being objectively reinforced by the virtual elimination of the
peasantry and by the increasing degree to which the “service” sectors and
intellectual professions are being subjected to factorylike working
conditions. *Subjectively*, however, this proletariat is still far removed
from any practical class consciousness, and this goes not only for
white-collar workers but also for blue-collar workers, who have yet to become
aware of any perspective beyond the impotence and mystifications of the old
politics. But when the proletariat discovers that its own externalized power
contributes to the constant reinforcement of capitalist society, no longer
only in the form of its alienated labor but also in the form of the trade
unions, political parties, and state powers that it had created in the effort
to liberate itself, it also discovers through concrete historical experience
that it is the class that must totally oppose all rigidified externalizations
and all specializations of power. It bears *a revolution that cannot leave
anything outside itself*, a revolution embodying the permanent domination of
the present over the past and a total critique of separation; and it must
discover the appropriate forms of action to carry out this revolution. No
quantitative amelioration of its impoverishment, no illusory participation in
a hierarchized system, can provide a lasting cure for its dissatisfaction,
because the proletariat cannot truly recognize itself in any particular wrong
it has suffered, nor in *the righting of any particular wrong*. It cannot
recognize itself even in the righting of many such wrongs, but only in the
righting of the *absolute wrong* of being excluded from any real life.

**115.** New signs of negation are proliferating in the most economically
advanced countries. Although these signs are misunderstood and falsified by
the spectacle, they are sufficient proof that a new period has begun. We have
already seen the failure of the first proletarian assault against capitalism;
now we are witnessing *the failure of capitalist abundance*. On one hand,
anti-union struggles of Western workers are being repressed first of all by
the unions; on the other, rebellious youth are raising new protests, protests
which are still vague and confused but which clearly imply a rejection of art,
of everyday life, and of the old specialized politics. These are two sides of
a new spontaneous struggle that is at first taking on a *criminal* appearance.
They foreshadow a second proletarian assault against class society. As the
lost children of this as yet immobile army reappear on this battleground — a
battleground which has changed and yet remains the same — they are following a
new “General Ludd” who, this time, urges them to attack the *machinery of
permitted consumption*.

**116.** “The long-sought political form through which the working class could
carry out its own economic liberation” has taken on a clear shape in this
century, in the form of revolutionary workers councils which assume all
decisionmaking and executive powers and which federate with each other by
means of delegates who are answerable to their base and revocable at any
moment. The councils that have actually emerged have as yet provided no more
than a rough hint of their possibilities because they have immediately been
opposed and defeated by class society’s various defensive forces, among which
their own false consciousness must often be included. As Pannekoek rightly
stressed, opting for the power of workers councils “poses problems” rather
than providing a solution. But it is precisely within this form of social
organization that the problems of proletarian revolution can find their real
solution. This is the terrain where the objective preconditions of historical
consciousness are brought together — the terrain where *active* direct
communication is realized, marking the end of specialization, hierarchy and
separation, and the transformation of existing conditions into “conditions of
unity.” In this process proletarian subjects can emerge from their struggle
against their contemplative position; their consciousness is equal to the
practical organization they have chosen for themselves because this
consciousness has become inseparable from coherent intervention in history.

**117.** With the power of the councils — a power that must internationally
supplant all other forms of power — the proletarian movement becomes its own
product. This product is nothing other than the producers themselves, whose
goal has become nothing other than their own fulfillment. Only in this way can
the spectacle’s negation of life be negated in its turn.

**118.** The appearance of workers councils during the first quarter of this
century was the most advanced expression of the old proletarian movement, but
it was unnoticed or forgotten, except in travestied forms, because it was
repressed and destroyed along with all the rest of the movement. Now, from the
vantage point of the new stage of proletarian critique, the councils can be
seen in their true light as the only undefeated aspect of a defeated movement.
The historical consciousness that recognizes that the councils are the only
terrain in which it can thrive can now see that they are no longer at the
periphery of a movement that is subsiding, but at the center of a movement
that is rising.

**119.** A revolutionary organization that exists before the establishment of
the power of workers councils will discover its own appropriate form through
struggle; but all these historical experiences have already made it clear that
it cannot claim to *represent* the working class. Its task, rather, is to
embody a radical separation from *the world of separation*.

**120.** Revolutionary organization is the coherent expression of the theory
of praxis entering into two-way communication with practical struggles, in the
process of becoming practical theory. Its own practice is to foster the
communication and coherence of these struggles. At the revolutionary moment
when social separations are dissolved, the organization must dissolve itself
as a separate organization.

**121.** A revolutionary organization must constitute an integral critique of
society, that is, it must make a comprehensive critique of all aspects of
alienated social life while refusing to compromise with any form of separate
power anywhere in the world. In the organization’s struggle with class
society, *the combattants themselves* are the fundamental weapons: a
revolutionary organization must thus see to it that the dominant society’s
conditions of separation and hierarchy are not reproduced within itself. It
must constantly struggle against its deformation by the ruling spectacle. The
only limit to participation in its total democracy is that each of its members
must have recognized and appropriated the coherence of the organization’s
critique — a coherence that must be demonstrated both in the critical theory
as such and in the relation between that theory and practical activity.

**122.** As capitalism’s ever-intensifying imposition of alienation at all
levels makes it increasingly hard for workers to recognize and name their own
impoverishment, putting them in the position of having to reject that
impoverishment *in its totality or not at all*, revolutionary organization has
had to learn that *it can no longer combat alienation by means of alienated
forms of struggle*.

**123.** Proletarian revolution depends entirely on the condition that, for
the first time, theory as understanding of human practice be recognized and
lived by the masses. It requires that workers become dialecticians and put
their thought into practice. It thus demands of its “people without qualities”
more than the bourgeois revolution demanded of the qualified individuals it
delegated to carry out its tasks (because the partial ideological
consciousness developed by a segment of the bourgeois class was based on the
economy, that central *part* of social life in which that class was *already
in power*). The development of class society to the stage of the spectacular
organization of nonlife is thus leading the revolutionary project to become
*visibly* what it has always been *in essence*.

**124.** Revolutionary theory is now the enemy of all revolutionary ideology,
*and it knows it*.

# Chapter 5: Time and History

> “O, gentlemen, the time of life is short! …
>
> An if we live, we live to tread on kings.”
>
> — Shakespeare, *Henry IV*

**125.** Man, “the negative being who *is* solely to the extent that he
suppresses Being,” is one with time. Man’s appropriation of his own nature is
at the same time his grasp of the development of the universe. “History is
itself a real part of *natural history*, of the transformation of nature into
man” (Marx). Conversely, this “natural history” has no real existence other
than through the process of human history, the only vantage point from which
one can take in that historical totality (like the modern telescope whose
power enables one to look back *in time* at the receding nebulas at the
periphery of the universe). History has always existed, but not always in its
historical form. The temporalization of humanity, brought about through the
mediation of a society, amounts to a humanization of time. The unconscious
movement of time becomes manifest and *true* within historical consciousness.

**126.** True (though *still hidden*) historical movement begins with the slow
and imperceptible development of the “real nature of man” — the “nature that
is born with human history, out of the generative action of human society.”
But even when such a society has developed a technology and a language and is
already a product of its own history, it is conscious only of a perpetual
present. Knowledge is carried on only by the *living*, never going beyond the
memory of the society’s oldest members. Neither death nor procreation is
understood as a law of time. Time remains motionless, like an enclosed space.
When a more complex society finally becomes conscious of time, it tries to
negate it — it views time not as something that passes, but as something that
*returns*. This static type of society organizes time in a *cyclical* manner,
in accordance with its own direct experience of nature.

**127.** Cyclical time is already dominant among the nomadic peoples because
they find the same conditions repeated at each stage of their journey. As
Hegel notes, “the wandering of nomads is only nominal because it is limited to
uniform spaces.” When a society settles in a particular location and gives
space a content by developing distinctive areas within it, it finds itself
confined within that locality. The periodic return to similar places now
becomes the pure return of time in the same place, the repetition of a
sequence of activities. The transition from pastoral nomadism to sedentary
agriculture marks the end of an idle and contentless freedom and the beginning
of labor. The agrarian mode of production, governed by the rhythm of the
seasons, is the basis for fully developed cyclical time. Eternity is *within*
this time, it is the return of the same here on earth. Myth is the unitary
mental construct which guarantees that the cosmic order conforms with the
order that this society has in fact already established within its frontiers.

**128.** The social appropriation of time and the production of man by human
labor develop within a society divided into classes. The power that
establishes itself above the poverty of the society of cyclical time, the
class that organizes this social labor and appropriates its limited surplus
value, simultaneously appropriates the *temporal surplus value* resulting from
its organization of social time: it alone possesses the irreversible time of
the living. The wealth that can only be concentrated in the hands of the
rulers and spent in extravagant festivities amounts to a squandering of
*historical time at the surface of society*. The owners of this historical
surplus value are the only ones in a position to know and enjoy real events.
Separated from the collective organization of time associated with the
repetitive production at the base of social life, this historical time flows
independently above its own static community. This is the time of adventure
and war, the time in which the masters of cyclical society pursue their
personal histories; it is also the time that emerges in the clashes with
foreign communities that disrupt the unchanging social order. History thus
arises as something alien to people, as something they never sought and from
which they had thought themselves protected. But it also revives the negative
human *restlessness* that had been at the very origin of this whole
(temporarily suspended) development.

**129.** In itself, cyclical time is a time without conflict. But conflict is
already present even in this infancy of time, as history first struggles to
become history in the practical activity of the masters. This history creates
a surface irreversibility; its movement constitutes the very time it uses up
within the inexhaustible time of cyclical society.

**130.** “Static societies” are societies that have reduced their historical
movement to a minimum and that have managed to maintain their internal
conflicts and their conflicts with the natural and human environment in a
constant equilibrium. Although the extraordinary diversity of the institutions
established for this purpose bears eloquent testimony to the flexibility of
human nature’s self-creation, this diversity is apparent only to the external
observer, the anthropologist who *looks back* from the vantage point of
historical time. In each of these societies a definitive organizational
structure has eliminated any possibility of change. The total conformism of
their social practices, with which all human possibilities are identified for
all time, has no external limit but the fear of falling back into a formless
animal condition. The members of these societies remain human at the price of
always remaining the same.

**131.** With the emergence of political power — which seems to be associated
with the last great technological revolutions (such as iron smelting) at the
threshold of a period that would experience no further major upheavals until
the rise of modern industry — kinship ties begin to dissolve. The succession
of generations within a natural, purely cyclical time begins to be replaced by
a linear succession of powers and events. This irreversible time is the time
of those who rule, and the dynasty is its first unit of measurement. Writing
is the rulers’ weapon. In writing, language attains its complete independence
as a mediation between consciousnesses. But this independence coincides with
the independence of separate power, the mediation that shapes society. With
writing there appears a consciousness that is no longer carried and
transmitted directly among the living — an *impersonal memory*, the memory of
the administration of society. “Writings are the thoughts of the state;
archives are its memory” (Novalis).

**132.** The chronicle is the expression of the irreversible time of power. It
also serves to inspire the continued progression of that time by recording the
past out of which it has developed, since this orientation of time tends to
collapse with the fall of each particular power and would otherwise sink back
into the indifferent oblivion of cyclical time (the only time known to the
peasant masses who, during the rise and fall of all the empires and their
chronologies, never change). The *owners of history* have given time a
*direction*, a direction which is also a *meaning*. But this history develops
and perishes separately, leaving the underlying society unchanged, because it
remains separated from the common reality. This is why we tend to reduce the
history of Oriental empires to a history of religions: the chronologies that
have fallen to ruins have left nothing but the seemingly independent history
of the illusions that veiled them. The masters who used the protection of myth
to *make history their private property* did so first of all in the realm of
illusion. In China and Egypt, for example, they long held a monopoly on the
immortality of the soul; and their earliest officially recognized dynasties
were nothing but imaginary reconstructions of the past. But this illusory
ownership by the masters was the only ownership then possible, both of the
common history and of their own history. As their real historical power
expanded, this illusory-mythical ownership became increasingly vulgarized. All
these consequences flowed from the simple fact that as the masters played the
role of mythically guaranteeing the permanence of cyclical time (as in the
seasonal rites performed by the Chinese emperors), they themselves achieved a
relative liberation from cyclical time.

**133.** The dry, unexplained chronology that a deified authority offered to
its subjects, who were supposed to accept it as the earthly fulfillment of
mythic commandments, was destined to be transcended and transformed into
conscious history. But for this to happen, sizeable groups of people had to
have experienced real participation in history. Out of this practical
communication between those who have *recognized each other* as possessors of
a unique present, who have experienced a qualitative richness of events in
their own activity and who are at home in their own era, arises the general
language of historical communication. Those for whom irreversible time truly
exists discover in it both the *memorable* and the *threat of oblivion:*
“Herodotus of Halicarnassus here presents the results of his researches, so
that time will not abolish the deeds of men…”

**134.** Examining history amounts to *examining the nature of power*. Greece
was the moment when power and changes in power were first debated and
understood. It was a *democracy of the masters* of society — a total contrast
to the despotic state, where power settles accounts only with itself, within
the impenetrable obscurity of its inner sanctum, by means of *palace
revolutions,* which are beyond the pale of discussion whether they fail or
succeed. But the shared power in the Greek communities was limited to the
*consumption* of a social life whose *production* remained the separate and
static domain of the servile class. The only people who lived were those who
did not work. The divisions among the Greek communities and their struggles to
exploit foreign cities were the externalized expression of the internal
principle of separation on which each of them was based. Although Greece had
dreamed of universal history, it did not succeed in unifying itself in the
face of foreign invasion, or even in unifying the calendars of its independent
city-states. Historical time became conscious in Greece, but it was not yet
conscious of itself.

**135.** The disappearance of the particular conditions that had favored the
Greek communities brought about a regression of Western historical thought,
but it did not lead to a restoration of the old mythic structures. The clashes
of the Mediterranean peoples and the rise and fall of the Roman state gave
rise instead to *semihistorical religions*, which became a new armor for
separate power and basic components of a new consciousness of time.

**136.** The monotheistic religions were a compromise between myth and
history, between the cyclical time that still governed the sphere of
production and the irreversible time that was the theater of conflicts and
regroupings among different peoples. The religions that evolved out of Judaism
were abstract universal acknowledgments of an irreversible time that had
become democratized and open to all, but only in the realm of illusion. Time
is totally oriented toward a single final event: “The Kingdom of God is soon
to come.” These religions were rooted in the soil of history, but they
remained radically opposed to history. The semihistorical religions establish
a qualitative point of departure in time (the birth of Christ, the flight of
Mohammed), but their irreversible time — introducing an accumulation that
would take the form of conquest in Islam and of increasing capital in
Reformation Christianity — is inverted in religious thought and becomes a sort
of *countdown:* waiting for time to run out before the Last Judgment and the
advent of the other, true world. Eternity has emerged from cyclical time, as
something beyond it. It is also the element that restrains the irreversibility
of time, suppressing history within history itself by positioning itself *on
the other side of irreversible time* as a pure point into which cyclical time
returns and disappears. Bossuet will still say: “By way of time, which passes,
we enter eternity, which does not pass.”

**137.** The Middle Ages, an incomplete mythical world whose consummation lay
outside itself, is the period when cyclical time, though still governing the
major part of production, really begins to be undermined by history. An
element of irreversible time is recognized in the successive stages of each
individual’s life. Life is seen as a one-way *journey* through a world whose
meaning lies elsewhere: the *pilgrim* is the person who leaves cyclical time
behind and actually becomes the traveler that everyone else is symbolically.
Personal historical life still finds its fulfillment within the sphere of
power, whether in struggles waged by power or in struggles over disputed
power; but power’s irreversible time is now shared to an unlimited degree due
to the general unity brought about by the oriented time of the Christian Era —
a world of *armed faith*, where the adventures of the masters revolve around
fealty and disputes over who owes fealty to whom. Feudal society was born from
the merging of “the organizational structures of the conquering armies that
developed in the process of conquest” with “the productive forces found in the
conquered regions” (*The German Ideology*), and the factors contributing to
the organization of those productive forces include the religious language in
which they were expressed. Social domination was divided between the Church
and the state, the latter power being in turn subdivided in the complex
relations of suzerainty and vassalage within and between rural domains and
urban communities. This diversification of potential historical life reflected
the gradual emergence (following the failure of that great official enterprise
of the medieval world, the Crusades) of the era’s unnoticed innovation: the
irreversible time that was silently undermining the society, the time
experienced by the bourgeoisie in the production of commodities, the
foundation and expansion of cities, and the commercial discovery of the planet
— a practical experimentation that destroyed every mythical organization of
the cosmos once and for all.

**138.** With the waning of the Middle Ages, the irreversible time that had
invaded society was experienced by a consciousness still attached to the old
order as an obsession with death. This was the melancholy of a world passing
away, the last world where the security of myth still counterbalanced history;
and for this melancholy all earthly things move inevitably toward decay. The
great European peasant revolts were also an attempt to *respond to history* —
a history that was violently wresting the peasants from the patriarchal
slumber that had been imposed by their feudal guardians. The millenarians’
utopian aspiration of *creating heaven on earth* revived a dream that had been
at the origin of the semihistorical religions, when the early Christian
communities, like the Judaic messianism from which they sprung, responded to
the troubles and misfortunes of their time by envisioning the imminent
realization of the Kingdom of God, thereby adding an element of unrest and
subversion to ancient society. When Christianity reached the point of sharing
power within the empire, it denounced whatever still remained of this hope as
mere superstition. This is what St. Augustine was doing when, in a formula
that can be seen as the archetype of all the modern ideological apologetics,
he declared that the Kingdom of God had in fact already come long ago — that
it was nothing other than the established Church. The social revolts of the
millenarian peasantry naturally began by defining their goal as the overthrow
of that Church. But millenarianism developed in a historical world, not on the
terrain of myth. Modern revolutionary hopes are not irrational continuations
of the religious passion of millenarianism, as Norman Cohn thought he had
demonstrated in *The Pursuit of the Millennium*. On the contrary,
millenarianism, revolutionary class struggle speaking the language of religion
for the last time, was already a modern revolutionary tendency, a tendency
that lacked only the consciousness that it was a *purely historical movement*.
The millenarians were doomed to defeat because they were unable to recognize
their revolution as their own undertaking. The fact that they hesitated to act
until they had received some external sign of God’s will was an ideological
corollary to the insurgent peasants’ practice of following leaders from
outside their own ranks. The peasant class could not attain a clear
understanding of the workings of society or of how to conduct its own
struggle, and because it lacked these conditions for unifying its action and
consciousness, it expressed its project and waged its wars with the imagery of
an earthly paradise.

**139.** The Renaissance was a joyous break with eternity. Though seeking its
heritage and legitimacy in the ancient world, it represented a new form of
historical life. Its irreversible time was that of a never-ending accumulation
of knowledge, and the historical consciousness engendered by the experience of
democratic communities and of the forces that destroy them now took up once
again, with Machiavelli, the analysis of secularized power, saying the
previously unsayable about the state. In the exuberant life of the Italian
cities, in the creation of festivals, life is experienced as an enjoyment of
the passage of time. But this enjoyment of transience is itself transient. The
song of Lorenzo de’ Medici, which Burckhardt considered “the very spirit of
the Renaissance,” is the eulogy this fragile historical festival delivers on
itself: “How beautiful the spring of life — and how quickly it vanishes.”

**140.** The constant tendency toward the monopolization of historical life by
the absolute-monarchist state — a transitional form on the way to complete
domination by the bourgeois class — brings into clear view the nature of the
bourgeoisie’s new type of irreversible time. The bourgeoisie is associated
with a *labor time* that has finally been freed from cyclical time. With the
bourgeoisie, work becomes *work that transforms historical conditions*. The
bourgeoisie is the first ruling class for which work is a value. And the
bourgeoisie, which suppresses all privilege and recognizes no value that does
not stem from the exploitation of labor, has appropriately identified its own
value as a ruling class with labor, and has made the progress of labor the
measure of its own progress. The class that accumulates commodities and
capital continually modifies nature by modifying labor itself, by unleashing
labor’s productivity. At the stage of absolute monarchy, all social life was
already concentrated within the ornamented poverty of the Court, the gaudy
trappings of a bleak state administration whose apex was the “profession of
king”; and all particular historical freedoms had to surrender to this new
power. The free play of the feudal lords’ irreversible time came to an end in
their last, lost battles — in the Fronde and in the Scottish uprising in
support of Bonny Prince Charlie. The world now had a new foundation.

**141.** The victory of the bourgeoisie is the victory of a *profoundly
historical* time, because it is the time corresponding to an economic
production that continuously transforms society from top to bottom. So long as
agrarian production remains the predominant form of labor, the cyclical time
that remains at the base of society reinforces the joint forces of
*tradition*, which tend to hold back any historical movement. But the
irreversible time of the bourgeois economy eradicates those vestiges
throughout the world. History, which until then had seemed to involve only the
actions of individual members of the ruling class, and which had thus been
recorded as a mere chronology of events, is now understood as a *general
movement* — a relentless movement that crushes any individuals in its path. By
discovering its basis in political economy, history becomes aware of what had
previously been unconscious; but this basis remains unconscious because it
cannot be brought to light. This blind prehistory, this new fate that no one
controls, is the only thing that the commodity economy has democratized.

**142.** The history that is present in all the depths of society tends to
become invisible at the surface. The triumph of irreversible time is also its
metamorphosis into a *time of things*, because the weapon that brought about
its victory was the mass production of objects in accordance with the laws of
the commodity. The main product that economic development has transformed from
a luxurious rarity to a commonly consumed item is thus history itself — but
only in the form of the history of the abstract movement of things that
dominates all qualitative aspects of life. While the earlier cyclical time had
supported an increasing degree of historical time lived by individuals and
groups, the irreversible time of production tends to socially eliminate such
lived time.

**143.** The bourgeoisie has thus made irreversible historical time known and
has imposed it on society, but it has prevented society from *using* it. “Once
there was history, but not any more,” because the class of owners of the
economy, which is inextricably tied to *economic history*, must repress every
other irreversible use of time because it is directly threatened by them all.
The ruling class, made up of *specialists in the possession of things* who are
themselves therefore possessed by things, is forced to link its fate with the
preservation of this reified history, that is, with the preservation of a new
immobility *within history*. Meanwhile the worker at the base of society is
for the first time not materially *estranged from history*, because the
irreversible movement is now generated from that base. By demanding to *live*
the historical time that it produces, the proletariat discovers the simple,
unforgettable core of its revolutionary project; and each previously defeated
attempt to carry out this project represents a possible point of departure for
a new historical life.

**144.** The irreversible time of the bourgeoisie that had just seized power
was at first called by its own name and assigned an absolute origin: Year One
of the Republic. But the revolutionary ideology of general freedom that had
served to overthrow the last remnants of a myth-based ordering of values,
along with all the traditional forms of social organization, was already
unable to completely conceal the real goal that it had draped in Roman
costume: unrestricted *freedom of trade*. Commodity society, discovering its
need to restore the passivity that it had so profoundly shaken in order to
establish its own unchallenged rule, now found that, for its purposes,
“Christianity with its cult of man in the abstract… is the most fitting form
of religion” (*Capital*). The bourgeoisie thus entered into a compromise with
that religion, a compromise also reflected in its presentation of time: the
Revolutionary calendar was abandoned and irreversible time returned to the
straitjacket of a duly extended *Christian Era*.

**145.** With the development of capitalism, irreversible time has become
*globally unified*. Universal history becomes a reality because the entire
world is brought under the sway of this time’s development. But this history
that is everywhere simultaneously the same is as yet nothing but an
intrahistorical rejection of history. What appears the world over as *the same
day* is merely the time of economic production, time cut up into equal
abstract fragments. This unified irreversible time belongs to the *global
market*, and thus also to the global spectacle.

**146.** The irreversible time of production is first of all the measure of
commodities. The time officially recognized throughout the world as the
*general time of society* actually only reflects the specialized interests
that constitute it, and thus is *merely one particular type of time*.

# Chapter 6: Spectacular Time

> “We have nothing of our own except time, which even the homeless can
> experience.”
>
> — Baltasar Gracián, *The Art of Worldly Wisdom*

**147.** The time of production — commodified time — is an infinite
accumulation of equivalent intervals. It is irreversible time made abstract,
in which each segment need only demonstrate by the clock its purely
quantitative equality with all the others. It has no reality apart from its
*exchangeability*. Under the social reign of commodified time, “time is
everything, man is nothing; he is at most the carcass of time” (*The Poverty
of Philosophy*). This devalued time is the complete opposite of time as
“terrain of human development.”

**148.** This general time of human nondevelopment also has a complementary
aspect — a *consumable* form of time based on the present mode of production
and presenting itself in everyday life as a *pseudocyclical time*.

**149.** This pseudocyclical time is in fact merely a *consumable disguise* of
the production system’s commodified time. It exhibits the latter’s essential
traits: homogenous exchangeable units and suppression of any qualitative
dimension. But as a by-product of commodified time whose function is to
promote and maintain the backwardness of everyday life, it is loaded with
pseudovalorizations and manifests itself as a succession of
pseudoindividualized moments.

**150.** Pseudocyclical time is associated with the consumption of modern
economic survival — the augmented survival in which everyday experience is cut
off from decisionmaking and subjected no longer to the natural order, but to
the pseudo-nature created by alienated labor. It is thus quite natural that it
echoes the old cyclical rhythm that governed survival in preindustrial
societies, incorporating the natural vestiges of cyclical time while
generating new variants: day and night, work and weekend, periodic vacations.

**151.** Pseudocyclical time is a time that has been *transformed by
industry*. The time based on commodity production is itself a consumable
commodity, one that recombines everything that the disintegration of the old
unitary societies had differentiated into private life, economic life, and
political life. The entire consumable time of modern society ends up being
treated as a raw material for various new products put on the market as
socially controlled uses of time. “A product that already exists in a form
suitable for consumption may nevertheless serve as raw material for some other
product” (*Capital*).

**152.** In its most advanced sectors, concentrated capitalism is increasingly
tending to market “fully equipped” blocks of time, each functioning as a
unified commodity combining a variety of other commodities. In the expanding
economy of “services” and leisure activities, the payment for these blocks of
time is equally unified: “everything’s included,” whether it is a matter of
spectacular living environments, touristic pseudotravel, subscriptions to
cultural consumption, or even the sale of sociability itself in the form of
“exciting conversations” and “meetings with celebrities.” Spectacular
commodities of this type, which would obviously never sell were it not for the
increasing impoverishment of the realities they parody, just as obviously
reflect the modernization of sales techniques by being payable on credit.

**153.** Consumable pseudocyclical time is spectacular time, both in the
narrow sense as time spent consuming images and in the broader sense as image
of the consumption of time. The time spent consuming images (images which in
turn serve to publicize all the other commodities) is both the particular
terrain where the spectacle’s mechanisms are most fully implemented and the
general goal that those mechanisms present, the focus and epitome of all
particular consumptions. Thus, the time that modern society is constantly
seeking to “save” by increasing transportation speeds or using packaged soups
ends up being spent by the average American in watching television three to
six hours a day. As for the social image of the consumption of time, it is
exclusively dominated by leisure time and vacations — moments portrayed, like
all spectacular commodities, *at a distance* and as desirable by definition.
These commodified moments are explicitly presented as moments of real life
whose cyclical return we are supposed to look forward to. But all that is
really happening is that the spectacle is displaying and reproducing itself at
a higher level of intensity. What is presented as true life turns out to be
merely a more *truly spectacular* life.

**154.** Although the present age presents itself as a series of frequently
recurring festivities, it is an age that knows nothing of real festivals. The
moments within cyclical time when members of a community joined together in a
luxurious expenditure of life are impossible for a society that lacks both
community and luxury. Its vulgarized pseudofestivals are parodies of real
dialogue and gift-giving; they may incite waves of excessive economic
spending, but they lead to nothing but disillusionments, which can be
compensated only by the promise of some new disillusion to come. The less use
value is present in the time of modern survival, the more highly it is exalted
in the spectacle. The reality of time has been replaced by the *publicity* of
time.

**155.** While the consumption of cyclical time in ancient societies was
consistent with the real labor of those societies, the pseudocyclical
consumption of developed economies contradicts the abstract irreversible time
implicit in their system of production. Cyclical time was the really lived
time of unchanging illusions. Spectacular time is the illusorily lived time of
a constantly changing reality.

**156.** The production process’s constant innovations are not echoed in
consumption, which presents nothing but an expanded repetition of the past.
Because dead labor continues to dominate living labor, in spectacular time the
past continues to dominate the present.

**157.** The lack of general historical life also means that individual life
as yet has no history. The pseudo-events that vie for attention in spectacular
dramatizations have not been lived by those who are informed about them; and
in any case they are soon forgotten due to their increasingly frenetic
replacement at every pulsation of the spectacular machinery. Conversely, what
is really lived has no relation to the society’s official version of
irreversible time, and conflicts with the pseudocyclical rhythm of that time’s
consumable by-products. This individual experience of a disconnected everyday
life remains without language, without concepts, and without critical access
to its own past, which has nowhere been recorded. Uncommunicated,
misunderstood and forgotten, it is smothered by the spectacle’s false memory
of the unmemorable.

**158.** The spectacle, considered as the reigning society’s method for
paralyzing history and memory and for suppressing any history based on
historical time, represents a *false consciousness of time*.

**159.** In order to force the workers into the status of “free” producers and
consumers of commodified time, it was first necessary to *violently
expropriate their time*. The imposition of the new spectacular form of time
became possible only after this initial dispossession of the producers.

**160.** The unavoidable biological limitations of the work force — evident
both in its dependence on the natural cycle of sleeping and waking and in the
debilitating effects of irreversible time over each individual’s lifetime —
are treated by the modern production system as strictly *secondary*
considerations. As such, they are ignored in that system’s official
proclamations and in the consumable trophies that embody its relentless
triumphant progress. Fixated on the delusory center around which his world
seems to move, the spectator no longer experiences life as a journey toward
fulfillment and toward death. Once he has given up on really living he can no
longer acknowledge his own death. Life insurance ads merely insinuate that he
may be guilty of dying without having provided for the smooth continuation of
the system following the resultant economic loss, while the promoters of the
“American way of death” stress his capacity to preserve most of the
*appearances* of life in his post-mortem state. On all the other fronts of
advertising bombardment it is strictly forbidden to grow old. Everybody is
urged to economize on their “youth-capital,” though such capital, however
carefully managed, has little prospect of attaining the durable and cumulative
properties of economic capital. This social absence of death coincides with
the social absence of life.

**161.** As Hegel showed, time is the *necessary* alienation, the terrain
where the subject realizes himself by losing himself, becomes other in order
to become truly himself. In total contrast, the current form of alienation is
imposed on the producers of an *estranged present*. In this *spatial
alienation*, the society that radically separates the subject from the
activity it steals from him is in reality separating him from his own time.
This potentially surmountable social alienation is what has prevented and
paralyzed the possibilities and risks of a *living* alienation within time.

**162.** Behind the *fashions* that come and go on the frivolous surface of
the spectacle of pseudocyclical time, the *grand style* of an era can always
be found in what is governed by the secret yet obvious necessity for
revolution.

**163.** The natural basis of time, the concrete experience of its passage,
becomes human and social by existing *for humanity*. The limitations of human
practice imposed by the various stages of labor have humanized time and also
dehumanized it, in the forms of cyclical time and of the separated
irreversible time of economic production. The revolutionary project of a
classless society, of an all-embracing historical life, implies the withering
away of the social measurement of time in favor of a *federation of
independent times* — a federation of playful individual and collective forms
of irreversible time that are simultaneously present. This would be the
temporal realization of authentic communism, which “abolishes everything that
exists independently of individuals.”

**164.** The world already dreams of such a time. In order to actually live
it, it only needs to become fully conscious of it.

**165.** Capitalist production has unified space, breaking down the boundaries
between one society and the next. This unification is at the same time an
extensive and intensive process of *banalization*. Just as the accumulation of
commodities mass-produced for the abstract space of the market shattered all
regional and legal barriers and all the Medieval guild restrictions that
maintained the *quality* of craft production, it also undermined the autonomy
and quality of *places*. This homogenizing power is the heavy artillery that
has battered down all the walls of China.

**166.** The *free space of commodities* is constantly being altered and
redesigned in order to become ever more identical to itself, to get as close
as possible to motionless monotony.

**167.** While eliminating geographical distance, this society produces a new
internal distance in the form of spectacular separation.

**168.** Tourism — human circulation packaged for consumption, a by-product of
the circulation of commodities — is the opportunity to go and see what has
been banalized. The economic organization of travel to different places
already guarantees their *equivalence*. The modernization that has eliminated
the time involved in travel has simultaneously eliminated any real space from
it.

**169.** The society that reshapes its entire surroundings has evolved its own
special technique for molding its own territory, which constitutes the
material underpinning for all the facets of this project. Urbanism — “city
planning” — is capitalism’s method for taking over the natural and human
environment. Following its logical development toward total domination,
capitalism now can and must refashion the totality of space into *its own
particular decor*.

**170.** The capitalist need that is satisfied by urbanism’s conspicuous
petrification of life can be described in Hegelian terms as a total
predominance of a “peaceful coexistence within space” over “the restless
becoming that takes place in the progression of time.”

**171.** While all the technical forces of capitalism contribute toward
various forms of separation, urbanism provides the material foundation for
those forces and prepares the ground for their deployment. It is the very
*technology of separation*.

**172.** Urbanism is the modern method for solving the ongoing problem of
safeguarding class power by atomizing the workers who have been dangerously
*brought together* by the conditions of urban production. The constant
struggle that has had to be waged against anything that might lead to such
coming together has found urbanism to be its most effective field of
operation. The efforts of all the established powers since the French
Revolution to increase the means of maintaining law and order in the streets
have finally culminated in the suppression of the street itself. Describing
what he terms “a one-way system,” Lewis Mumford points out that “with the
present means of long-distance mass communication, sprawling isolation has
proved an even more effective method of keeping a population under control”
(*The City in History*). But the general trend toward isolation, which is the
underlying essence of urbanism, must also include a controlled reintegration
of the workers based on the planned needs of production and consumption. This
reintegration into the system means bringing isolated individuals together *as
isolated individuals*. Factories, cultural centers, tourist resorts and
housing developments are specifically designed to foster this type of
pseudocommunity. The same collective isolation prevails even within the
*family cell*, where the omnipresent receivers of spectacular messages fill
the isolation with the ruling images — images that derive their full power
precisely from that isolation.

**173.** In all previous periods architectural innovations were designed
exclusively for the ruling classes. Now for the first time a new architecture
has been specifically designed *for the poor*. The aesthetic poverty and vast
proliferation of this new experience in habitation stem from its *mass*
character, which character in turn stems both from its function and from the
modern conditions of construction. The obvious core of these conditions is the
*authoritarian decisionmaking* which abstractly converts the environment into
an environment of abstraction. The same architecture appears everywhere as
soon as industrialization has begun, even in the countries that are furthest
behind in this regard, as an essential foundation for implanting the new type
of social existence. The contradiction between the growth of society’s
material powers and the continued *lack of progress* toward any conscious
control of those powers is revealed as glaringly by the developments of
urbanism as by the issues of thermonuclear weapons or of birth control (where
the possibility of manipulating heredity is already on the horizon).

**174.** The self-destruction of the urban environment is already well under
way. The explosion of cities into the countryside, covering it with what
Mumford calls “a formless mass of thinly spread semi-urban tissue,” is
directly governed by the imperatives of consumption. The dictatorship of the
automobile — the pilot product of the first stage of commodity abundance — has
left its mark on the landscape with the dominance of freeways, which tear up
the old urban centers and promote an ever-wider dispersal. Within this process
various forms of partially reconstituted urban fabric fleetingly crystallize
around “distribution factories” — giant shopping centers built in the middle
of nowhere and surrounded by acres of parking lots. These temples of frenetic
consumption are subject to the same irresistible centrifugal momentum, which
casts them aside as soon as they have engendered enough surrounding
development to become overburdened secondary centers in their turn. But the
technical organization of consumption is only the most visible aspect of the
general process of decomposition that has brought the city to the point of
*consuming itself*.

**175.** Economic history, whose entire previous development centered around
the opposition between city and country, has now progressed to the point of
nullifying both. As a result of the current *paralysis* of any historical
development beyond the independent movement of the economy, the incipient
disappearance of city and country does not represent a *transcendence* of
their separation, but their simultaneous collapse. The mutual erosion of city
and country, resulting from the failure of the historical movement through
which existing urban reality could have been overcome, is reflected in the
eclectic mixture of their decomposed fragments that blanket the most
industrialized regions of the world.

**176.** Universal history was born in cities, and it reached maturity with
the city’s decisive victory over the country. For Marx, one of the greatest
merits of the bourgeoisie as a revolutionary class was the fact that it
“subjected the country to the city,” whose “very air is liberating.” But if
the history of the city is a history of freedom, it is also a history of
tyranny — a history of state administrations controlling not only the
countryside but the cities themselves. The city has served as the historical
battleground for the struggle for freedom without yet having been able to win
it. The city is the *focal point of history* because it embodies both a
concentration of social power, which is what makes historical enterprises
possible, and a consciousness of the past. The current destruction of the city
is thus merely one more reflection of humanity’s failure, thus far, to
subordinate the economy to historical consciousness; of society’s failure to
unify itself by reappropriating the powers that have been alienated from it.

**177.** “The country represents the complete opposite: isolation and
separation” (*The German Ideology*). As urbanism destroys the cities, it
recreates a *pseudocountryside* devoid both of the natural relations of the
traditional countryside and of the direct (and directly challenged) social
relations of the historical city. The conditions of habitation and spectacular
control in today’s “planned environment” have created an artificial
neopeasantry. The geographical dispersal and the narrow-mindedness that have
always prevented the peasantry from undertaking independent action and
becoming a creative historical force are equally characteristic of these
modern producers, for whom a world of their own making is as inaccessible as
were the natural rhythms of work in agrarian societies. The peasantry was the
steadfast foundation of “Oriental despotism,” in that its inherent
fragmentation gave rise to a natural tendency toward bureaucratic
centralization. The neopeasantry produced by the increasing bureaucratization
of the modern state differs from the old in that its *apathy* must now be
*historically manufactured* and maintained; natural ignorance has been
replaced by the organized spectacle of falsification. The landscape of the
“new cities” inhabited by this technological pseudopeasantry is a glaring
expression of the repression of historical time on which they have been built.
Their motto could be: “Nothing has ever happened here, and nothing ever will.”
The forces of *historical absence* have been able to create their own
landscape because historical liberation, which must take place in the cities,
has not yet occurred.

**178.** The history that threatens this twilight world could potentially
subject space to a directly experienced time. Proletarian revolution is this
*critique of human geography* through which individuals and communities could
create places and events commensurate with the appropriation no longer just of
their work, but of their entire history. The ever-changing playing field of
this new world and the freely chosen variations in the rules of the game will
regenerate a diversity of local scenes that are independent without being
insular. And this diversity will revive the possibility of authentic
*journeys* — journeys within an authentic life that is itself understood as a
journey containing its whole meaning within itself.

**179.** The most revolutionary idea concerning urbanism is not itself
urbanistic, technological or aesthetic. It is the project of reconstructing
the entire environment in accordance with the needs of the power of workers
councils, of the *antistate dictatorship* of the proletariat, of executory
dialogue. Such councils can be effective only if they transform existing
conditions in their entirety; and they cannot set themselves any lesser task
if they wish to be recognized and *to recognize themselves* in a world of
their own making.

> — Ruge to Marx, March 1843

**180.** Culture is the general sphere of knowledge and of representations of
lived experiences within historical societies divided into classes. It is a
generalizing power which itself exists as a *separate entity*, as division of
intellectual labor and as intellectual labor of division. Culture detached
itself from the unity of myth-based society “when human life lost its unifying
power and when opposites lost their living connections and interactions and
became autonomous” (*The Difference Between the Systems of Fichte and
Schelling*). In thus gaining its independence, culture embarked on an
imperialistic career of self-enrichment that ultimately led to the decline of
that independence. The history that gave rise to the relative autonomy of
culture, and to the ideological illusions regarding that autonomy, is also
expressed as the history of culture. And this whole triumphant history of
culture can be understood as a progressive revelation of the inadequacy of
culture, as a march toward culture’s self-abolition. Culture is the terrain of
the quest for lost unity. In the course of this quest, culture as a separate
sphere is obliged to negate itself.

**181.** In the struggle between tradition and innovation, which is the basic
theme of internal cultural development in historical societies, innovation
always wins. But cultural innovation is generated by nothing other than the
total historical movement — a movement which, in becoming conscious of itself
as a whole, tends to go beyond its own cultural presuppositions and thus to
move toward the suppression of all separations.

**182.** The rapid expansion of society’s knowledge, including the
understanding that history is the underlying basis of culture, led to the
irreversible self-knowledge reflected by the destruction of God. But this
“first condition of any critique” is also the first task of a critique without
end. When there are no longer any tenable rules of conduct, each *result* of
culture pushes culture toward its own dissolution. Like philosophy the moment
it achieved full independence, every discipline that becomes autonomous is
bound to collapse — first as a credible pretension to give a coherent account
of the social totality, and ultimately even as a fragmented methodology that
might be workable within its own domain. Separate culture’s *lack of
rationality* is what dooms it to disappear, because that culture already
embodies a striving for the victory of the rational.

**183.** Culture grew out of a history that dissolved the previous way of
life, but as a separate sphere within a *partially historical* society its
understanding and sensory communication inevitably remain partial. It is the
meaning of an insufficiently meaningful world.

**184.** The end of the history of culture manifests itself in two opposing
forms: the project of culture’s self-transcendence within total history, and
its preservation as a dead object for spectacular contemplation. The first
tendency has linked its fate to social critique, the second to the defense of
class power.

**185.** Each of these two forms of the end of culture has a unitary
existence, both within all the aspects of knowledge and within all the aspects
of sensory representation (that is, within what was formerly understood as
*art* in the broadest sense of the word). In the case of knowledge, the
accumulation of branches of fragmentary knowledge, which become unusable
because *approval* of existing conditions ultimately requires *renouncing
one’s own knowledge*, is opposed by the theory of praxis which alone has
access to the truth of all these forms of knowledge since it alone knows the
secret of their use. In the case of sensory representations, the critical
self-destruction of society’s former *common language* is opposed by its
artificial reconstruction within the commodity spectacle, the illusory
representation of nonlife.

**186.** Once society has lost its myth-based community, it loses all the
reference points of truly common language until such time as the divisions
within the inactive community can be overcome by the inauguration of a real
historical community. When art, which was the common language of social
inaction, develops into independent art in the modern sense, emerging from its
original religious universe and becoming individual production of separate
works, it too becomes subject to the movement governing the history of all
separate culture. Its declaration of independence is the beginning of its end.

**187.** The *positive* significance of the modern decomposition and
destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost.
The *negative* implication of this development is that a common language can
no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the
art of historical societies — *belated* portrayals of *someone else’s*
dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable — but must now be
found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate
language. The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue
and the game with time that up till now have merely been *represented* by
poetic and artistic works.

**188.** When art becomes independent and paints its world in dazzling colors,
a moment of life has grown old. Such a moment cannot be rejuvenated by
dazzling colors, it can only be evoked in memory. The greatness of art only
emerges at the dusk of life.

**189.** The historical time that invaded art was manifested first of all in
the sphere of art itself, beginning with the *baroque*. Baroque was the art of
a world that had lost its center with the collapse of the last mythical order:
the Medieval synthesis of a unified Christianity with the ghost of an Empire,
which had harmonized heavenly and earthly government. The *art of change*
inevitably embodied the same ephemerality that it discovered in the world. As
Eugenio d’Ors put it, it chose “life instead of eternity.” The outstanding
achievements of baroque were in theater and festival, or in theatrical
festivals, where the sole purpose of each particular artistic expression was
to contribute to the composition of a scene, a scene which had to serve as its
own center of unification; and that center was the *passage*, the expression
of a threatened equilibrium within the overall dynamic disorder. The somewhat
excessive emphasis on the concept of baroque in contemporary aesthetic
discussions reflects the awareness that an artistic classicism is no longer
possible. The attempts to establish a normative classicism or neoclassicism
during the last three centuries have been nothing but short-lived artificial
constructs speaking the official language of the state (whether of the
absolute monarchy or of the revolutionary bourgeoisie draped in Roman togas).
What eventually followed baroque, once it had run its course, was an ever more
individualistic art of negation which, from romanticism to cubism, continually
renewed its assaults until it had fragmented and destroyed the entire artistic
sphere. The disappearance of historical art, which was linked to the internal
communication of an elite and which had its semi-independent social basis in
the partially playful conditions still experienced by the last aristocracies,
also reflects the fact that capitalism is the first form of class power that
acknowledges its own total lack of ontological quality — a power whose basis
in the mere management of the economy is symptomatic of the loss of all human
*mastery*. The comprehensive unity of the baroque ensemble, which has long
been lacking in the world of artistic *creation*, has in a sense been revived
in today’s wholesale *consumption* of the totality of past art. As all the art
of the past comes to be recognized and appreciated historically, and is
retrospectively reclassified as phases of a single “world art,” it is
incorporated into a global disorder that can itself be seen as a sort of
baroque structure at a higher level, a structure that absorbs baroque art
itself along with all its possible revivals. For the first time in history the
arts of all ages and civilizations can be known and accepted together, and the
fact that it has become possible to collect and recollect all these
art-historical memories marks the *end of the world of art*. In this age of
museums in which artistic communication is no longer possible, all the
previous expressions of art can be accepted equally, because whatever
particular communication problems they may have had are eclipsed by all the
present-day obstacles to communication *in general*.

**190.** Art in its period of dissolution — a movement of negation striving
for its own transcendence within a historical society where history is not yet
directly lived — is at once an art of change and the purest expression of the
impossibility of change. The more grandiose its pretensions, the further from
its grasp is its true fulfillment. This art is necessarily *avant-garde*, and
at the same time it *does not really exist*. Its vanguard is its own
disappearance.

**191.** Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of
modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were
contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian
movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the
very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental
reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically
linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most
important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed
the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to
*abolish art without realizing it;* surrealism sought to *realize art without
abolishing it*. The critical position since developed by the *situationists*
has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of
a single *transcendence of art*.

**192.** The spectacular consumption that preserves past culture in congealed
form, including coopted rehashes of its negative manifestations, gives overt
expression in its cultural sector to what it implicitly is in its totality:
the *communication of the incommunicable*. The most extreme destruction of
language can be officially welcomed as a positive development because it
amounts to yet one more way of flaunting one’s acceptance of a status quo
where all communication has been smugly declared absent. The critical truth of
this destruction — the real life of modern poetry and art — is obviously
concealed, since the spectacle, whose function is to *use culture to bury all
historical memory*, applies its own essential strategy in its promotion of
modernistic pseudoinnovations. Thus a school of neoliterature that baldly
admits that it does nothing but contemplate the written word for its own sake
can pass itself off as something new. Meanwhile, alongside the simple claim
that the death of communication has a sufficient beauty of its own, the most
modern tendency of spectacular culture — which is also the one most closely
linked to the repressive practice of the general organization of society —
seeks by means of “collective projects” to construct complex neoartistic
environments out of decomposed elements, as can be seen in urbanism’s attempts
to incorporate scraps of art or hybrid aesthetico-technical forms. This is an
expression, in the domain of spectacular pseudoculture, of advanced
capitalism’s general project of remolding the fragmented worker into a
“socially integrated personality,” a tendency that has been described by
recent American sociologists (Riesman, Whyte, etc.). In all these areas the
goal remains the same: to *restructure society without community*.

**193.** As culture becomes completely commodified it tends to become the star
commodity of spectacular society. Clark Kerr, one of the foremost ideologues
of this tendency, has calculated that the complex process of production,
distribution and consumption of *knowledge* already accounts for 29% of the
gross national product of the United States; and he predicts that in the
second half of this century the “knowledge industry” will become the driving
force of the American economy, as was the automobile in the first half of this
century and the railroad in the last half of the previous century.

**194.** The task of the various branches of knowledge that are in the process
of developing *spectacular thought* is to justify an unjustifiable society and
to establish a general science of false consciousness. This thought is totally
conditioned by the fact that it cannot recognize, and does not want to
recognize, its own material dependence on the spectacular system.

**195.** The official thought of the social organization of appearances is
itself obscured by the generalized *sub**communication* that it has to defend.
It cannot understand that conflict is at the origin of everything in its
world. The specialists of spectacular power — a power that is absolute within
its realm of one-way communication — are absolutely corrupted by their
experience of contempt and by the success of that contempt, because they find
their contempt confirmed by their awareness of how *truly contemptible*
spectators really are.

**196.** As the very triumphs of the spectacular system pose new problems, a
new division of tasks appears within the specialized thought of that system.
On one hand, a *spectacular critique of the spectacle* is undertaken by modern
sociology, which studies separation exclusively by means of the conceptual and
material instruments of separation. On the other, the various disciplines
where structuralism has become entrenched are developing an *apologetics of
the spectacle* — a mindless thought that imposes an *official amnesia*
regarding all historical practice. But the fake despair of nondialectical
critique and the fake optimism of overt promotion of the system are equally
submissive.

**197.** The sociologists who have begun to raise questions about the living
conditions created by modern social developments (first of all in the United
States) have gathered a great deal of empirical data, but they have failed to
grasp the true nature of their object of study because they fail to recognize
the critique that is inherent in that object. As a result, those among them
who sincerely wish to reform these conditions can only appeal to ethical
standards, common sense, moderation, and other measures that are equally
inadequate for dealing with the problems in question. Because this method of
criticism is unaware of the negativity at the heart of its world, it focuses
on describing and deploring an excessive sort of negativity that seems to
blight the surface of that world like some irrational parasitic infestation.
This outraged good will, which even within its own moralizing framework ends
up blaming only the external consequences of the system, can see itself as
critical only by ignoring the essentially *apologetic* character of its
assumptions and methods.

**198.** Those who denounce the affluent society’s incitement to wastefulness
as absurd or dangerous do not understand the purpose of this wastefulness. In
the name of economic rationality, they ungratefully condemn the faithful
irrational guardians that keep the power of this economic rationality from
collapsing. Daniel Boorstin, for example, whose book *The Image* describes
spectacle-commodity consumption in the United States, never arrives at the
concept of the spectacle because he thinks he can treat private life and
“honest commodities” as separate from the “excesses” he deplores. He fails to
understand that the commodity itself made the laws whose “honest” application
leads both to the distinct reality of private life and to its subsequent
reconquest by the social consumption of images.

**199.** Boorstin describes the excesses of a world that has become foreign to
us as if they were excesses foreign to our world. When, like a moral or
psychological prophet, he denounces the superficial reign of images as a
product of “our extravagant expectations,” he is implicitly contrasting these
excesses to a “normal” life that has no reality in either his book or his era.
Because the real human life that Boorstin evokes is located for him in the
past, including the past that was dominated by religious resignation, he has
no way of comprehending the true extent of the present society’s domination by
images. We can truly understand this society only by *negating* it.

**200.** A sociology that believes that a separately functioning industrial
rationality can be isolated from social life as a whole may go on to view the
techniques of reproduction and communication as independent of general
industrial development. Thus Boorstin concludes that the situation he
describes is caused by an unfortunate but almost fortuitous encounter of an
excessive technology of image-diffusion with an excessive appetite for
sensationalism on the part of today’s public. This amounts to blaming the
spectacle on modern man’s excessive inclination to be a spectator. Boorstin
fails to see that the proliferation of the prefabricated “pseudo-events” he
denounces flows from the simple fact that the overwhelming realities of
present-day social existence prevent people from actually living events for
themselves. Because history itself haunts modern society like a specter,
pseudohistories have to be concocted at every level in order to preserve the
threatened equilibrium of the present *frozen time*.

**201.** The current tendency toward *structuralist* systematization is based
on the explicit or implicit assumption that this brief freezing of historical
time will last forever. The antihistorical thought of structuralism believes
in the eternal presence of a system that was never created and that will never
come to an end. Its illusion that all social practice is unconsciously
determined by preexisting structures is based on illegitimate analogies with
structural models developed by linguistics and anthropology (or even on models
used for analyzing the functioning of capitalism) — models that were *already
inaccurate even in their original contexts*. This fallacious reasoning stems
from the limited intellectual capacity of the *academic functionaries* hired
to expound this thought, who are so thoroughly caught up in their awestruck
celebration of the existing system that they can do nothing but reduce all
reality to the existence of that system.

**202.** In order to understand “structuralist” categories, one must bear in
mind that such categories, like those of any other historical social science,
reflect forms and conditions of existence. Just as one does not judge an
individual by what he thinks about himself, one cannot judge or admire this
particular society by assuming that the language it speaks to itself is
necessarily true. “We cannot judge such a period of transformation by its own
consciousness; on the contrary, that consciousness must be explained in the
light of the contradictions of material life…” Structures are the progeny of
established powers. Structuralism is *thought underwritten by the state*, a
form of thought that regards the present conditions of spectacular
“communication” as an absolute. Its method of studying code in isolation from
content is merely a reflection of a taken-for-granted society where
communication takes the form of a cascade of hierarchical signals.
Structuralism does not prove the transhistorical validity of the society of
the spectacle; on the contrary, it is the society of the spectacle, imposing
itself in its overwhelming reality, that validates the frigid dream of
structuralism.

**203.** The critical concept of “the spectacle” can also undoubtedly be
turned into one more hollow formula of sociologico-political rhetoric used to
explain and denounce everything *in the abstract*, thus serving to reinforce
the spectacular system. It is obvious that ideas alone cannot lead beyond the
existing spectacle; at most, they can only lead beyond existing ideas about
the spectacle. To actually destroy the society of the spectacle, people must
set a practical force into motion. A critical theory of the spectacle cannot
be true unless it unites with the practical current of negation in society;
and that negation, the resumption of revolutionary class struggle, can for its
part only become conscious of itself by developing the critique of the
spectacle, which is the theory of its real conditions — the concrete
conditions of present-day oppression — and which also reveals its hidden
potential. This theory does not expect miracles from the working class. It
envisages the reformulation and fulfillment of proletarian demands as a
long-term task. To make an artificial distinction between theoretical and
practical struggle (for the formulation and communication of the type of
theory envisaged here is already inconceivable without a *rigorous practice*),
it is certain that the obscure and difficult path of critical theory must also
be the fate of the practical movement acting on the scale of society.

**204.** Critical theory must *communicate itself* in its own language — the
language of contradiction, which must be dialectical in both form and content.
It must be an all-inclusive critique, and it must be grounded in history. It
is not a “zero degree of writing,” but its reversal. It is not a negation of
style, but the style of negation.

**205.** The very style of dialectical theory is a scandal and abomination to
the prevailing standards of language and to the sensibilities molded by those
standards, because while it makes concrete use of existing concepts it
simultaneously recognizes their *fluidity* and their inevitable destruction.

**206.** This style, which includes a critique of itself, must express the
domination of the present critique *over its entire past*. Dialectical
theory’s mode of exposition reveals the negative spirit within it. “Truth is
not like some finished product in which one can no longer find any trace of
the tool that made it” (Hegel). This theoretical consciousness of a movement
whose traces must remain visible within it is manifested by the *reversal* of
established relationships between concepts and by the *détournement* of all
the achievements of earlier critical efforts. Hegel’s practice of reversing
the genitive was an expression of historical revolutions, though that
expression was confined to the form of thought. The young Marx, inspired by
Feuerbach’s systematic reversal of subject and predicate, achieved the most
effective use of this *insurrectional style*, which answers “the philosophy of
poverty” with “the poverty of philosophy.” Détournement reradicalizes previous
critical conclusions that have been petrified into respectable truths and thus
transformed into lies. Kierkegaard already used it deliberately, though he
also denounced it: “But despite all your twists and turns, just as jam always
returns to the pantry, you always end up introducing some little phrase which
is not your own, and which awakens disturbing recollections” (*Philosophical
Fragments*). As he acknowledged elsewhere in the same book, this use of
détournement requires maintaining one’s *distance* from whatever has been
turned into an official truth: “One further remark regarding your many
complaints that I introduced borrowed expressions into my exposition. I do not
deny that I did so. It was in fact done deliberately. In the next section of
this work, if I ever write such a section, I intend to call this topic by its
true name and to clothe the problem in its historical attire.”

**207.** Ideas improve. The meaning of words plays a role in that improvement.
Plagiarism is necessary. Progress depends on it. It sticks close to an
author’s phrasing, exploits his expressions, deletes a false idea, replaces it
with the right one.

**208.** Détournement is the opposite of quotation, of appealing to a
theoretical authority that is inevitably tainted by the very fact that it has
become a quotation — a fragment torn from its own context and development, and
ultimately from the general framework of its period and from the particular
option (appropriate or erroneous) that it represented within that framework.
Détournement is the flexible language of anti-ideology. It appears in
communication that knows it cannot claim to embody any definitive certainty.
It is language that cannot and need not be confirmed by any previous or
supracritical reference. On the contrary, its own internal coherence and
practical effectiveness are what validate the previous kernels of truth it has
brought back into play. Détournement has grounded its cause on nothing but its
own truth as present critique.

**209.** The element of *overt* détournement in formulated theory refutes any
notion that such theory is durably autonomous. By introducing into the
theoretical domain the same type of *violent subversion* that disrupts and
overthrows every existing order, détournement serves as a reminder that theory
is nothing in itself, that it can realize itself only through historical
action and through the *historical correction* that is its true allegiance.

**210.** The real values of culture can be maintained only by negating
culture. But this negation can no longer be a *cultural* negation. It may in a
sense take place within culture, but it points beyond it.

**211.** In the language of contradiction, the critique of culture is a
*unified* critique, in that it dominates the whole of culture — its knowledge
as well as its poetry — and in that it no longer separates itself from the
critique of the social totality. This *unified theoretical critique* is on its
way to meet *unified social practice*.

**212.** Ideology is the intellectual *basis* of class societies within the
conflictual course of history. Ideological expressions have never been pure
fictions; they represent a distorted consciousness of realities, and as such
they have been real factors that have in turn produced real distorting
effects. This interconnection is intensified with the advent of the spectacle
— the *materialization* of ideology brought about by the concrete success of
an autonomized system of economic production — which virtually identifies
social reality with an ideology that has remolded all reality in its own
image.

**213.** Once ideology — the *abstract* will to universality and the illusion
associated with that will — is legitimized by the universal abstraction and
the effective dictatorship of illusion that prevail in modern society, it is
no longer a voluntaristic struggle of the fragmentary, but its triumph.
Ideological pretensions take on a sort of flat, positivistic precision: they
no longer represent historical choices, they are assertions of undeniable
facts. The particular *names* of ideologies thus tend to disappear. The
specifically ideological forms of system-supporting labor are reduced to an
“epistemological base” that is itself presumed to be beyond ideology.
Materialized ideology has no name, just as it has no formulatable historical
agenda. Which is another way of saying that the history of *different
ideologies* is over.

**214.** Ideology, whose whole internal logic led toward what Mannheim calls
“total ideology” — the despotism of a fragment imposing itself as
pseudoknowledge of a frozen *totality*, as a *totalitarian* worldview — has
reached its culmination in the immobilized spectacle of nonhistory. Its
culmination is also its dissolution into society as a whole. When that society
itself is *concretely dissolved*, ideology — the *final irrationality*
standing in the way of historical life — must also disappear.

**215.** The spectacle is the acme of ideology because it fully exposes and
manifests the essence of all ideological systems: the impoverishment,
enslavement and negation of real life. The spectacle is the material
“expression of the separation and estrangement between man and man.” The “new
power of deception” concentrated in it is based on the production system in
which “as the mass of objects increases, so do the alien powers to which man
is subjected.” This is the supreme stage of an expansion that has turned need
against life. “The need for money is thus the real need created by the modern
economic system, and the only need it creates” (*Economic and Philosophical
Manuscripts*). Hegel’s characterization of money as “the self-moving life of
what is dead” (*Jenenser Realphilosophie*) has now been extended by the
spectacle to all social life.

**216.** In contrast to the project outlined in the “Theses on Feuerbach” (the
realization of philosophy in a praxis transcending the opposition between
idealism and materialism), the spectacle preserves the ideological features of
both materialism and idealism, imposing them in the pseudoconcreteness of its
universe. The contemplative aspect of the old materialism, which conceives the
world as representation and not as activity — and which ultimately idealizes
matter — is fulfilled in the spectacle, where concrete things are automatic
masters of social life. Conversely, the *dreamed activity* of idealism is also
fulfilled in the spectacle, through the technical mediation of signs and
signals — which ultimately materialize an abstract ideal.

**217.** The parallel between ideology and schizophrenia demonstrated in
Gabel’s *False Consciousness* should be considered in the context of this
economic materialization of ideology. Society has become what ideology already
was. The repression of practice and the antidialectical false consciousness
that results from that repression are imposed at every moment of everyday life
subjected to the spectacle — a subjection that systematically destroys the
“faculty of encounter” and replaces it with a *social hallucination:* a false
consciousness of encounter, an “illusion of encounter.” In a society where no
one can any longer be *recognized* by others, each individual becomes
incapable of recognizing his own reality. Ideology is at home; separation has
built its own world.

**218.** “In clinical descriptions of schizophrenia,” says Gabel, “the
disintegration of the dialectic of totality (with dissociation as its extreme
form) and the disintegration of the dialectic of becoming (with catatonia as
its extreme form) seem closely interrelated.” Imprisoned in a flattened
universe bounded by the *screen* of the spectacle that has enthralled him, the
spectator knows no one but the *fictitious speakers* who subject him to a
one-way monologue about their commodities and the politics of their
commodities. The spectacle as a whole serves as his looking glass. What he
sees there are dramatizations of illusory escapes from a universal autism.

**219.** The spectacle obliterates the boundaries between self and world by
crushing the self besieged by the presence-absence of the world. It also
obliterates the boundaries between true and false by repressing all directly
lived truth beneath the *real presence* of the falsehood maintained by the
organization of appearances. Individuals who passively accept their subjection
to an alien everyday reality are thus driven toward a madness that reacts to
this fate by resorting to illusory magical techniques. The essence of this
pseudoresponse to an unanswerable communication is the acceptance and
consumption of commodities. The consumer’s compulsion to imitate is a truly
infantile need, conditioned by all the aspects of his fundamental
dispossession. As Gabel puts it in describing a quite different level of
pathology, “the abnormal need for representation compensates for an agonizing
feeling of being at the margin of existence.”

**220.** In contrast to the logic of false consciousness, which cannot truly
know itself, the search for critical truth about the spectacle must also be a
true critique. It must struggle in practice among the irreconcilable enemies
of the spectacle, and admit that it is nothing without them. By rushing into
sordid reformist compromises or pseudorevolutionary collective actions, those
driven by an abstract desire for immediate effectiveness are in reality
obeying the ruling laws of thought, adopting a perspective that can see
nothing but the *latest news*. In this way delirium reappears in the camp that
claims to be opposing it. A critique seeking to go beyond the spectacle must
*know how to wait*.

**221.** The self-emancipation of our time is an emancipation from the
material bases of inverted truth. This “historic mission of establishing truth
in the world” can be carried out neither by the isolated individual nor by
atomized and manipulated masses, but only and always by the class that is able
to dissolve all classes by reducing all power to the de-alienating form of
realized democracy — to councils in which practical theory verifies itself and
surveys its own actions. This is possible only when individuals are “directly
linked to universal history” and dialogue arms itself to impose its own
conditions.
